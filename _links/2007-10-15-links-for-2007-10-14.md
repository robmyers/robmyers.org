[The spectre of free information](http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/stories/20071019507610000.htm)

  


Excellent interview with Eben Moglen in which he discusses Free Software and how it relates to Free Culture, as well as how to pay artists under Free Culture.

[An apology to Ursula K Le Guin - Boing Boing](http://www.boingboing.net/2007/10/14/an-apology-to-ursula.html#more)

  


Cory shows some class in an apology to Ursula K Le Guin over a Fair Use dispute. The links are interesting as well, although I wouldn't use Le Guin or Pournelle's posts as guides to copyright law, and the call to reinstate the e-piracy group is bogus.
