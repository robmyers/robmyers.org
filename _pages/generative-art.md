Generative Art computing uses software to make varied and unexpected images.

Some of my [Glitch](/glitch-aesthetics/) and [Bot](/artbots/) projects could be regarded as Generative Art, and some of them are based on projects listed here.

I wrote about Generative Art for issue 3 of [Vague Terrain Journal](http://vagueterrain.net/vt-journal) in 2006.

**[Paintr](/paintr/), 2005/2013, PHP code (later Lisp code) reimplemented in node.js .**

A network services era model of of almost precisely how artistic inspiration doesn't work. See it on [tumblr](http://paintr-rebooted.tumblr.com/).



![draw-something](/assets/2013/12/draw-something-image.jpg)
**[draw-something]( /draw-something/), 2004-, Common Lisp code, later JavaScript code.**

draw-something is a generative drawing program inspired by Harold Cohen's [AARON](http://www.aaronshome.com/aaron/). It is based on simple models of line drawing, figure creation, and colour choice. You can see the output of an instance of the current JavaScript version on [tumblr](http://draw-something-rebooted.tumblr.com/).



[![minara](/assets/2012/07/minara.gif)](/assets/2012/07/minara.gif)
**[minara, 2003-2006, C and Scheme code.](/minara/)**

An Emacs-inspired "Lisp code all the way down" graphics editor for generative drawing.
