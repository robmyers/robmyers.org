A multitcultural art from China, India and the Middle East. A challenge to received wisdom and logistics for an international audience and trade network rendering the specific and local exchangeable and valorizabled culturally and economically.

A youthful art of remix, resistance and defiance from Asia and the former Soviet Union.

**Art Coin Yellow ([http://dogepartychain.info/asset/YELLOWARTCOIN](http://dogepartychain.info/asset/YELLOWARTCOIN))**

An art from New York and Berlin, found on blogs and made from obsolescent media. Ironic and depthless yet sophisticatedly deployed to create aesthetics through overwhelming assemblages of kitsch in a year both zero and final.
