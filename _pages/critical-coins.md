**Critical Coins, 2015, Dogeparty Tokens.**

To make the process of art reviews and criticism more transparent and quantifiable, we can use cryptographic asset tokens to represent critical opinion and valences.

**Critical Approval**

Here's a token of simple, uninflected critical approval:

[CRITIQUE](http://dogepartychain.info/asset/CRITIQUE)

**Positive and Negative Critique**

Positive-only measures can distort valences. Having tokens both for approval and disapproval addresses this:

[POSCRIT](http://dogepartychain.info/asset/POSCRIT)

[NEGCRIT](http://dogepartychain.info/asset/NEGCRIT)

**Star Ratings**

We can use a range of tokens to express a traditional star rating:

[ONESTAR](http://dogepartychain.info/asset/ONESTAR)

[TWOSTAR](http://dogepartychain.info/asset/TWOSTAR)

[THREESTAR](http://dogepartychain.info/asset/THREESTAR)

[FOURSTAR](http://dogepartychain.info/asset/FOURSTAR)

[FIVESTAR](http://dogepartychain.info/asset/FIVESTAR)

**Sending Tokens**

We can use three different kinds of recipients for critical opinion represented in the form of tokens. If the artist (or work) has a Dogecoin address the tokens can be sent to that address directly. Otherwise we can create (preferably a vanity) address for them to hold the tokens in escrow. Or we can create an unspendable address (again preferably a vanity address) to send the tokens to. This prevents the tokens being transferred, which is either a bug or a feature depending on whether we want this to be possible or not.

Presumably art is the product of aesthetic competence, and if I as an art historian or critic approve of your exercise of this competence I cannot fault you if your exercise of that competence in the evaluation of someone else's art or critical competences leads you to transfer the tokens of my critical approval to a third party. So transferable tokens make sense and in fact the history of their transferals adds value, it provides a historical record of regard, influence, and my original opinion.

**Call For Review Subjects**

If you have a Dogecoin address and art to review, contact me with a message signed by that address containing the URL of that art and I'll take a look.
