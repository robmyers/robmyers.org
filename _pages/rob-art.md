**Installation And Use**

![](/assets/2012/07/drawinga.png)

You will need a Lisp compiler (I use SBCL and OpenMCL) and some ability with the command line. Get the current source from SourceForge CVS or the most recent release from SourceForge downloads. CVS is better.

To run draw-something:

    cd rob-art/draw-something
    sbcl
    (load "load.lisp")
    (run)
