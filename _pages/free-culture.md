Free culture art is art that respects and protects your freedom of expression.

My "[Shareable Readymades](/shareable-readymades/)" are an explicit comment on the way art's economics interacts with cultural liberty.

My [Art Bots](/artbots/) and [Generative Art](/generative-art/) projects also use and generate free cultural works.

I contributed the essay "Open Source Art Again" to the excellent [FLOSS+Art](http://goto10.org/flossart/) book, you can find the original post it was expanded from [here](/2006/09/20/open-source-art-again/).

The free play of forms increasingly inspired by love and desire. The imagery and colours draw on smileys/emoticons, on graphic design for popular music, and on confectionery wrappers.

**[Mixes](/mixes/), 1993, digital images.**

These would be called Mashups now. They sample and combine what was then considered to be canonical British contemporary art in order to create visual and conceptual relationships between, interrogating and critiquing them and making something new.
