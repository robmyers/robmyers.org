**Artworld Ethereum, 2014-, Ethereum DApps.**

Ethereum is a Bitcoin-style system for implementing "smart contracts", a very literal take on Lawrence Lessig's idea that code is law. Smart contracts can be used to implement smart property, physical goods governed by computer code, and Distributed Autonomous Organizations, which replace written constitutions with code running on Ethereumâ€™s Blockchain.

We can apply this technology to the production, exhibition, critique and institutions of art. And we can apply art and its historical strategies of engagement with questions of property, ownership, organization, distribution and so on to the critique of the technology and ideology that Ethereum represents.

For a practical overview of the possibilities see here:
