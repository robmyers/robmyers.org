**draw-something, 2004-, Common Lisp code, later JavaScript code.**

draw-something is a generative drawing program inspired by Harold Cohen's [AARON](http://www.aaronshome.com/aaron/). It is based on simple models of line drawing, figure creation, and colour choice.

You can see the output of an instance of the current JavaScript version on tumblr [here](http://draw-something-rebooted.tumblr.com/) and download the source code [here](https://gitorious.org/robmyers/drawsomethingnode/) and [here](https://gitorious.org/robmyers/draw-something-js/).

The source code for the older but more advanced Lisp version can be found [here](https://gitorious.org/robmyers/draw-something/).
