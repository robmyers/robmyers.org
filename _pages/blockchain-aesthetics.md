**Blockchain Aesthetics, 2014-2015, HTML5 and JavaScript.**

Visualizing Bitcoin blockchain transactions - click on each image to run in your browser.

Bitcoin transactions rendered as a rows of coloured squares. Each byte of the 32-byte transaction hash is rendered as a square of colour from a 256-colour palette:

Transactions rendered as paragraphs consisting of words from a standard list:

Each transaction hash rendered as a 16x16 1-bit bitmap (original Macintosh-style, 1 is black):

Transactions rendered as spots of colour from a 256-colour palette:

Transactions rendered as drawings of lines connecting x,y co-ordinate pairs taken from the low and high 4 bits in each 8-bit byte in the 32-byte transaction hash. Each transaction is joined to the next as part of the same continuous drawing:

As above, with a face recognition algorithm used to find any collections of pixels that accidentally resemble faces. These are outlined in red:

Each hash as instructions for a turtle graphics pen:

Life games with each hash as the starting board state:

A Chernoff Face of each hash:

Cellular automata with each hash as the initial row:

Quadratic curves with the bytes of each hash as the control point co-ordinates:
