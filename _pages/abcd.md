## Essays & Reviews


I've also written on this subject for the art, technology and society collective Furtherfield:


_Rob Myers brings together the history of conceptual art and the future of Bitcoin-style blockchain technology for what would have been a panel presentation at The White Building for V&A Digital Futures: Money No Object._


[(Conceptual) Art, Cryptocurrency and Beyond](http://www.furtherfield.org/features/conceptual-art-cryptocurrency-and-beyond)


_With sculptures that sell themselves on eBay and cryptocurrencies for owning GIF images, art is already in the era of smart contracts. It's time to use the same technology to solve the crisis of art cirticism. Are you ready for the Accelerationist future of critique on the blockchain?_


[The ABC of Accelerationist Blockchain Critique](http://furtherfield.org/features/abc-accelerationist-blockchain-critique)


_"Computers and Capital: The Rise of Digital Currency" at Coinfest 2014 in Vancouver and online is a net art exploration of Bitcoin. Rob Myers takes a look at how the artists involved rise to the task of visualising the social and technical complexities of the popular but troubled cryptocurrency._
