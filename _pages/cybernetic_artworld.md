**The Cybernetic Artworld, 2009, Common Lisp code, later Python code, then node.js code.**

A micro-artworld that is a simple and almost entirely incorrect model of the real one. You can get the original Common Lisp source code [here](https://gitorious.org/robmyers/cybernetic-artworld/), the Python version [here](https://gitorious.org/robmyers/microblog-bots/), or the node.js version (in progress) [here](https://gitorious.org/robmyers/artbots/).

The critic reads those posts and critiques them, offering an opinion on their worth. They also explain how their aesthetics change over time. _They'll be back soon._
