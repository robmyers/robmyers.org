**Mixes, 1993, digital images.**

These would be called Mashups now. They sample and combine what was then considered to be canonical British contemporary art in order to create visual and conceptual relationships between, interrogating and critiquing them and making something new.

The images were created using morphing software on a DOS computer, photographed using an early Canon digital camera then printed using its accompanying printer.

Because they use unlicensed third party images, the images in this series are not under a Creative Common license.
