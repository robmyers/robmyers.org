**artbollocks-mode, 2011, Emacs Lisp code.**

"[Art Bollocks](http://www.eyemagazine.com/blog/post/art-bollocks-is-everywhere-you-look)" is a better and older name than "[International Art English](http://www.canopycanopycanopy.com/contents/international_art_english)" for the opaque and otiose [Artspeak](http://www.theguardian.com/culture-professionals-network/culture-professionals-blog/2013/may/03/artspeak-examples-what-not-to-write) used in press releases, in journals and on blogs. I wrote artbollocks-mode, or AB as it discreetly identifies itself on the Emacs status line, to help art writers avoid it, starting with myself. As the above example shows, nobody's perfect.

I recommend [Sacha Chua](https://sachachua.com/)'s improved version of AB , see here: [https://github.com/sachac/artbollocks-mode](https://github.com/sachac/artbollocks-mode)
