title: The Entropy Man

---

"[The Dice Man](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dice_Man)" by Luke Rhinehart is a 1971 novel about the consequences of making life-altering decisions using the roll of a die. The use of chance operations in art was common in mid-20th-Century avant-gardes but, reacting against his background in psychiatry, Rhinehart applied them to more consequential decision making.

We can use cryptographic hashes rather than dice as the source of entropy for aleatory, chance operations in art and decision making.
