Harold Cohen gave a good talk, and a good Q&A session afterwards (including fielding questions from Huw Jones from the Landsdowne Centre For Electronic Arts and Dave Bausola from Ixi). I managed to meet Harold and briefly say hello beforehand.  
  
I can't do justice to the talk in a weblog entry, so it's fortunate that a video of the talk will soon be online [here](http://www.tate.org.uk/onlineevents/archive/). The talk ranged over Harold Cohen's introduction to computing, the potential of technology, the artistic demands of expertise and technological innovation in an "idiot-proof" age, the struggle to explain colour to AARON, how AARON's latest work came about, and more.  
  
AARON's latest work is painting-based with a wider range of objects, shadows, and more expressive virtual "brushwork" as well as a new palette made possible by its new archival quality large-scale inkjet printer. It's strange seeing AARON's plants and other objects without their traditional black outlines, but AARON is now truly painting rather than colouring drawings. I do wonder about "simulating" the layering of opaque colour to be rendered flat by an inkjet printer: this feels different from the physical "proofs" AARON has produced previously, but the results certainly look good and the effect could be achieved with real opaque paint anyway. I think I missed several minutes of the talk just looking at the slides of the new images as they were shown. I'll need to check that archive myself to see what I missed. :-)
