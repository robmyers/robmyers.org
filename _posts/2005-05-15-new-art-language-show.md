A&L are back at the Lisson with new work, old films of performances with The Red Crayola, and a Karaoke bar.  
  
Altogether now:  
  
"Jackson Pollock was the artist of the Marshall Plan  
He broke ice for artists when the Cold War began..."  
  
What do you mean you don't know the words? Everone knows the words to "A Portrait of Lenin In The Style Of Jackson Pollock (Part I)"!
