Dave Gerard's comment on Foundation-L neatly encapsulates the problem with Wikimedia's actions and with the defences of them that I have seen so far, stating of the artistsÂ  -  


<blockquote>_They're performance artists. This is more performance. They fooled the EFF into playing along._</blockquote>

The problem is that people's first amendment free speech rights are being dismissed _because they are artists_.  
  
The EFF wouldn't have had to "play along" if Wikimedia hadn't decided, despite the history of first amendment protection for non-commercial, critical and _artistic_ use of trademarks by artists, that art is less deserving of protection as free speech than simple verbal abuse would be.
