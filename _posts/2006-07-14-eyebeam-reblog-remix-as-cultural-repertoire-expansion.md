[Eyebeam reBlog: Remix as Cultural Repertoire Expansion](http://www.eyebeam.org/reblog/archives/2006/07/remix_as_cultural_repertoire_exp.html)  
  
_Allowing and encouraging remix is a way that media companies can expand their cultural repertoires not just at the level of individual works, but also at the level of the possible expressions of those works. Any given single production is likely to fail, but given a broad set of variants of that production, at least one is likely to hit it big._
