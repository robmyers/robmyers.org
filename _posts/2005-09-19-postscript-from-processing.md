PostScript was my first coding love. I worked on PostScript viruses at art school, and I still use it today as the output format for draw-something.  


  
So it's great to see a PostScript output library for [Processing](http://www.processing.org/), and to see it being used for some cool stuff (via [Generator.x](http://www.generatorx.no/20050918/processing-postscript-grafitti/)):
