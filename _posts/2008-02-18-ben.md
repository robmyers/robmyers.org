After reading the excellent "Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming" by Peter Norvig, I've started on a toy re-implementation of Harold Cohen's AARON. It's based on AARON circa 1978, so it's production-system and pixel based, but in Lisp rather than C. After some deliberation I've named it Ben, which follows AARON alphabetically, and is smaller.  
  
Here's a test of the current version:

This isn't a replacement for draw-something, which is inspired by AARON but very different both in terms of how it's programmed and the images it produces.
