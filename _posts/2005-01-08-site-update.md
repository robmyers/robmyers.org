I've updated this weblog to register on technorati and to work with Firefox/Mozilla's Live Bookmarks (via homepage.mac.com, not robmyers.org :-/).  
  
Seeing the links to this blog on other sites is embarrasing: iBlog generates very long URLs. Not as bad as WebObjects, but still not really human-usable. Maybe I should switch to bloxsom. Or something. I did have my own blog generating script, but it seems silly to continue reinventing the wheel by updating that.
