I'm working on a vector graphics equivalent to Latham & Todd's mutator. The first (trivial) stage is to create random vector scribbles.

These can then be evolved into something better over successive generations of mutation and visual evaluation. At the moment the scribbles are just lists of drawing instructions, but transformation and iteration functions will make the images more structured.
