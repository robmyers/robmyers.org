[](http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/mindperfhks/index.html) Mind Performance Hacks  
  
De Bono, Buzan, 43 Folders, Bowie & Eno, the Oulipo, and more in an O'Reilly book. It's qute mind blowing, a wonderful collection of creative ideas and influences, all with suggestions for further reading, and will save you months of research and search. It will also allow you to nod sagely when your friends mention Oblique Strategies, The Oulipo, their Hipster PDA, or an exoself.  
The author even provides Perl scripts for some of this stuff. :-)  
  
Extremely recommended.
