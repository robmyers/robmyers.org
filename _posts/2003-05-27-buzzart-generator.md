I've written a simple random painting description generator in Prolog and I'm working on getting it compiling as a full-screen Java application using Prolog Cafe.  
The choice algorithm is random, but the choices are structured hierarchically so there is structure to the generated descriptions. I'm going to add complexity to it and start working on non-random choices.
