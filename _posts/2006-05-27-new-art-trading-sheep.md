[New Art: Trading Sheep](http://new-art.blogspot.com/2006/05/trading-sheep_114858956840113559.html)  
  
Someone else gets the sheep! This is the best artwork I've seen this year. It moves the content of art on, expanding what and how you can show. You can look at it conceptually or relationally, but that its aesthetics is thought provoking (and in part provoked by thought) leads to the internal complexity of the artwork, not any tedious essays about it. This goes to the audience, and it takes the audience new places.
