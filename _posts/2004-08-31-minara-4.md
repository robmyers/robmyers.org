A bank holiday weekend of hacking sees menu handling, keymap handling, a test framework and buffer s-expression picking finally in SourceForge CVS.  
There' some picking and masking code in there along with some colour handling code, but those parts are incomplete.  
I think I'm going to pull the pen tool together next, which will give the buffer and redrawing code a work-out, then finally work out transformations.  
I've been thinking about how to handle macros, functions, and multi-file projects. I think I might need to patch eval (and maybe define and defmacro) for picking in more complex scenarios, unless I can always get access to the call stack from Guile. I need to check that. :-)
