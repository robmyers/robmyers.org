(From Aesthetics-L)  
  
I look forward to the first book on art by a chef. We will find that  
aesthetics is inferior to cooking, that pigments are inferior to  
spices, that the gesamtkunstwerk is a sizzling platter, and that  
criticism should be replaced by large gratuities. Sadly this is  
self-undermining, as the chef must themself eat.
