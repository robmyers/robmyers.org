There's overlap between the eye of colour poetics and the eye of cognitive science. They meet in the compression schemes used by digital image systems such as computers and cable TV to squeeze pictures over networks by throwing away details the eye isn't supposed to notice then reconstituting them later using a standard replacement scheme. In my day jobs I've had to learn to spot "compression artefacts" from too much information being thrown away in such images. I have trouble watching cable sometimes...  
The images of "Titled" are standard colour contrast illustrations from colour theory manuals (and "zips", but thats another story) degraded by computer compression. The two-dimensional equivalent of Turk's Judd cubes, only more two-sided. They look aesthetic, which says something computational about aesthetics or something aesthetic about computation. I had to make them, it was necessary.  
They're uncomfortably pretty images.
