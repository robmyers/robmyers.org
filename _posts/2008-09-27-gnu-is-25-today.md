It's the twenty-first anniversary of the announcement of the GNU project today. GNU is a project to create a Free Software operating system, that is software for your computer that does not allow other people to restrict your freedom to use it.  
  
I'm writing this on a laptop running Fedora, which is a Free Software distribution based on GNU. I'm writing it in Firefox, also Free Software, using Movable Type, again Free Software, running on a Free Software web server.   
  
From almost no Free Software a quarter of a century ago to pervasive Free Software today. There is always more work to be done, and new threats to the freedom to use software freely, but GNU has been a great success. Never let anyone tell you that pragmatism is more important or more powerful than ethics.   
  
Happy birthday GNU!
