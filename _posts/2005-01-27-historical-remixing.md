Whilst searching for CC art to remix (is there any outside of Remix Reading???) I found a couple of older CC postings that I may have mentioned but are worth mentioning again:  
  
[Franz Liszt, Mixmaster, and J.S. Bach, Klepto  
  
](http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/3640)[The Creative Remix](http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/4470)[   
  
](http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/3640)The next time anyone complains to you about those kids today stealing other people's art, ask them if they know what a canto is. :-)
