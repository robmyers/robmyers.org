There are many Web 2,0 sites that allow you to organize projects using Wikis, checklists of to-do items, calendars and other systems. These can be of use to artists.  
  
37 Signals are the leaders in this area but their work is not Free Software so I recommend [Joyent's Connector](http://www.joyent.com/connector) and [Wikidot instead,](http://www.wikidot.com/) or even better software installed on your own server.  
  
Two posts from 37 Signals's blog illusttrate how to use Web 2.0 productivity services to help organize art practice.

Use a todo/checklist service to remind you of ideas you have yet to try or tasks that you need to complete for a project. Then when you return to the project after an interruption you can quickly remind yourself of what needs doing.

](http://37signals.blogs.com/products/2008/08/backpack-helps.html)Use a wiki-style service to gather research materials such as images, references and notes for a project.  
  
Although these examples are for software develoment and an academic research respectively it is easy to see how their lessons can be used to help organize art porjects.
