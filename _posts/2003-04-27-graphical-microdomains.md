High Modernist art is full of graphical microdomains. Its grids, stripes, spots and simple geometries are much easier for programs to work on than an impressionist canvas and allow useful activity to be demonstrated without having to build a general visual parser first. Stripes are particularly useful as they are effectively one-dimensional, making relationships between each element much simpler for a program to manage.
