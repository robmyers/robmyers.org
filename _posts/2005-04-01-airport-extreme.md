I got an Airport Extreme brick. It's very good. "Regret" by New Order is playing over my old speakers plugged into it at the moment. And I'm posting this from my iBook over the other side of the room.  
  
As always, the network didn't "just work". It pretended to, but I had to tweak the settings. This would be beyond many users, and isn't what I expect from Apple.  
  
"Stop Me If You've Heard This One Before" - The Smiths.  
  
I think Apple should invest in some pretty major AI. I just want to turn on Airport and have a daemon exhaustively try to make the network work. Surely that's doable?
