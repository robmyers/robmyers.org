[Boing Boing: Stephen Fry Talking Clock goes Creative Commons](http://www.boingboing.net/2007/05/09/stephen_fry_talking_.html)  
  
_Dave talked the manufacturers of the Stephen Fry Talking Clock into releasing their Stephen Fry samples as open, Creative Commons licensed clips_  
  
One of the very useful thought experiments that we discussed during the Creative Commons 3.0 licenses debate on the cc-licenses mailing list was what happened if a musical snowglobe used CC licensed music coded into its ROM and played through its piezo speaker.  
  
With the Stephen Fry clock the rightsholder is both making the embedded electronics and licensing the samples, so there's no problem. But this is close enough to life imitating thought experiment that I found it amusing.
