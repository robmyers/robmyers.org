[DRAFT Creative Commons Statement of Intent for Attribution-ShareAlike Licenses - Creative Commons](http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8186)

<blockquote>_This draft statement attempts describe 1 what CC does as a license developer and steward, 2 why CC Attribution-ShareAlike licenses play a special role in the movement for free cultural works â€” clearly inspired by the free software movement, and 3 CC's intentions as steward of Attribution-ShareAlike licenses, in the context of 1 and 2._</blockquote>

This looks absolutely excellent. Take a look, and if you have any comments you can make them on the CC wiki or on the cc-licenses list.
