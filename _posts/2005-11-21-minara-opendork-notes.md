**Basics**  


  
A tool for generative 2D graphics inspired by Emacs.  


  
"A programmable graphics program editor."  


  
Minara Is Not A Recursive Acronym. And apparently "minara" means "lighthouse" in one language.  


  
Written in a little C and lots of Scheme, using OpenGL (GLUT). Runs on Mac & Linux so far.  


  
The tools and the software are written in the same language as the graphics files. Simple & unified.  


  
So not like Inkscape or Illustrator, which split implementation/tool/graphics language.  


  
Open and customisable all the way down.  


  
**Drawing**  


  
Pen.  
  
Shapes.  
  
Zoom, pan, panic.  
  
Undo/redo.  
  
Colour.  


  
**Development**  


  
Opening the file in an external editor, editing, reloading.  


  
Opening .minara file in an external editor, editing, reloading.  


  
Can develop and edit tools whilst running the application and editing graphics.  


  
**Simple Generative Stuff**  


  
Subjects.  


  
Random Walk.  


  
**ToDo**  


  
Picking, copy, paste.
