The follow up to 1968 is of course titled "1969". See the sketches at my [sketchblog](/sketchblog/), where they're still titled "1968". This is the source material of 1968 increasingly distorted, selectively presented and divorced from reality. So its a continuation of the allegory.  
I'm working on the images in my old copy of Illustrator 6 (!) in Classic because I just can't get used to working in Inkscape and I can't afford Illustrator CS. :-( Using familiar tools is having a positive effect this time. :-) I just wish I could find my copy of Letraset Envelopes. :-/
