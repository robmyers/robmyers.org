Earlier in the year, some researchers wired rat neurons to a couple of coloured felt-tip pens over the internet to get scribbly "drawings". Voila! Art, not bad vivisectionist "science". The transformational power of art is truly amazing.  
[Article.](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3096973.stm)  
Inspired by this, I propose a project to make science in the same way. Some rat anus cells will be wired to a computer running a scientific typesetting program. Dip the cells in lemon juice. Voila! Scientific equations, not a bad nominative art stunt.  
Don't get me wrong, I'm quite happy for Damien Hirst to get out his chainsaw, but if a researcher has bad conscience, they shouldn't try to hide it under a sugar coating of "art".
