I hung out at the FSF offices on Friday to help prepare for Libre Planet. If you've ever wondered where donations to the FSF go then let me assure you that it's money well spent. The team are very capable and are focussed on software freedom, and their offices are modest and well organised.  
  
(It was great to see one of the team wearing one of the t-shirts I designed as well.)
