Open Congress was very good. The word "notion" was intoned into oblivion, Deleuze was indeed mentioned, and too many institutional types were confusing cultural openness with organisational openness, but the art ecology was great.  


  
Well, it was great on the Friday. I couldn't be there on the Saturday so I missed Libre and Loca.  


  
All attendees had to sign a CC-BY-NC disclaimer, which was a good idea. I discussed CC and art with people, and contributed a dot to an artwork in the foyer.  


  
I'm still not used to people knowing who I am. In this instance Cory Doctorow and Ken Wark. I now have a copy of "A Hacker Manifesto" signed and inscribed with the line of my review from this blog that Ken didn't like. ;-)
