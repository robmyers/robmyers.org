[Emoticon](http://www.teuton.org/~stranger/code/emoticon/emoticon.html)_Emoticon is a programming langauge based on emoticons, or smileys, such as those that excessivly litter many bad emails and Usenet postings. In Emoticon these smileys become program instructions, while anything surrounding them becomes data. With some cunning it should be possible to embed Emoticon code in any normal message, though any reader would probably end up being very confused at what mood you were trying to convey!__A web based Emoticon Interpreter, written in PHP, is available on this site. _Thanks Dave!
