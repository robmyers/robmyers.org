[Thinking About Art: Artists Interview Artists: Rob Myers  
](http://thinkingaboutart.blogs.com/art/2006/05/artists_intervi_7.html)_  
Rob Myers, an artist from Peterborough, England, participates in the Artists Interview Artists Project. Below Rob responds to another artist's five questions (William Andrews from Starkville, MS). In order to participate, Rob had to provide me with five questions for some other artist to answer. The assigning of questions to artists is completely random_.
