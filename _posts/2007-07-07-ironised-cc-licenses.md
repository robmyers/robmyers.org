These are working so well that I think I'm going to make them into a series of published artworks. Despite just being intended as a satire for a small section of the Free Culture community they've grown in the making to mean something more. I've some further images to in the series to make, then I'll rework any that need it and format everything up for a release. I'll probably give the project a snappier title as well.  
  
Thank you to everyone who has given me feedback on these, notably MANIK and Crosbie Fitch. I should also mention that actually starting this project was triggered in a positive way by MTAA's comments at iCommons regarding when the license of an artwork might be interesting.
