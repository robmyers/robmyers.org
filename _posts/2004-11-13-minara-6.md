It's not as hard as I thought to add an intersection handler, so I've added one and now Minara doesn't crash when the pen tool is being used.  
This means that I can keep using OpenGL rather than switching to libart or another rendering library. So I can concentrate on refactoring and adding new code next month instead. Yay!
