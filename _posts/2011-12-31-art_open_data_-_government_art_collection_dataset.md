I have written a script to download a dataset containing collection information from the UK [Government Art Collection](http://www.gac.culture.gov.uk/) site and save it in tab-seperated-value files and an sqlite database for easy access. As the data is from a UK government agency it's under the [OGL](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/).  
  
You don't need to run the script, a downloaded dataset is included in the project archive:  
  
[https://gitorious.org/robmyers/government-art-collection/](https://gitorious.org/robmyers/government-art-collection/)  
  
[https://gitorious.org/robmyers/government-art-collection/trees/master/2011-12-11](https://gitorious.org/robmyers/government-art-collection/trees/master/2011-12-11)  
  
The dataset doesn't feature as many collections as the GAC website claims to feature, but the script does omit many duplicates. This project was inspired by [Kasabi](https://gitorious.org/robmyers/government-art-collection/trees/master/2011-12-11)'s scraper, adding the ability to download code and data in an easy-to-use format.
