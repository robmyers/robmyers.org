[Museum, Inc](http://www.prickly-paradigm.com/catalog.html#fa05)  


  
_Museum, Inc. describes from the inside the new arts conglomerates, whose roots are deeply imbedded in corporate culture. A critical analysis based on the author's nine years at the Guggenheim Museum, this pamphlet shows that the "Global Museum" is not the radical break with the past it claims to be but a logical outcome in the evolution of cultural institutions rooted in the eighteenth-century Enlightenment, the colonial expansion of the liberal nation-state, and the rhetoric of freedom and democracy._  


  
Insightful, incisive, written from the inside and very, very funny. Highly recommended as an institutional critique of contemporary.
