**How I made this image.**  


  
I found a palette at colr called Scheme 6608 with the following tags: rhododenderon, pink, flowers, girly, barbie. and searched for those tags on flickr.  
  
I found an image at flickr called [P5287975]('http://flickr.com/photos/64013914@N00/16141944/') by Works of Art which had the tags flower, flowers, garden, iowa, and I traced that using autotrace.  
  
I then applied the colr palette to the autotraced flickr picture in my own unique way to make this finished image.  
  
I hope you like it!
