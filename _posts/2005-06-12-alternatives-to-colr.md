colr.org is down at the moment. One of the questions paintr asks is "What happens if a service you base your work on goes down?". I didn't expect to get such a quick answer. :-)  


  
The colr website lists some alternatives to colr.org, I'll have to recode paintr to be able to use one of them instead:  


  
[COLOURlovers](http://www.colourlovers.com/)  


  
[ColorWhore](http://www.colorwhore.com/)  


  
[Colorspeak](http://bulltown.com/colorspeak/1/)  


  
Or there's an algorithmic palette generator:  


  
[Colour Scheme Generator 2](http://wellstyled.com/tools/colorscheme2/index-en.html)  


  
But that goes against the folksonomy emphasis of paintr.
