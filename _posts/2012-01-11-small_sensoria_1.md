This is the test setup for "Small Sensoria". It is several LEDs being (mis-used) as light sensors connected to an Arduino. The USB cable connects them to a computer running a Processing sketch that renders the light intensities.  
  
The values can be plotted linearly:

You can get the Arduino and Processing source code here:
