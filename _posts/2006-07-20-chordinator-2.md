chordinator is the name of the stand-alone colour palette generator for rob-art. It's based on the system that Harold Cohen describes in "Colouring Without Seeing".

I think I need to combine the brightness and saturation scores into a single value, and possibly add weights for different parts of the colour wheel.  


  
When it's working well I'll roll the code into draw-something (it currently uses copied-and-pasted versions of the colour and postscript code).
