I've just finished [Lessig](http://www.lessig.org/) 's "[Free Culture](http://www.free-culture.cc/) ". It's excellent. Read it. Now. :-)  
  
This is one of the few times in history where art can be effectively political. Not by content but by the way it is made and distributed. Put anything you make under a [Creative Commons](http://www.creativecommons.org/) license (make sure you understand the legal implications of this...) and let people build on your work.
