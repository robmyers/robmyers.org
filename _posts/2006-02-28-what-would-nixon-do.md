I just got "Endtroducing" and "Zoolook" in the post. Zoolook I've heard before, Endtroduing is new (I was an UNKLE fan though). Add this to my Utah Saints records, some Negativland and DJ Sooky, and I'm having a sampletastic time at the moment trying to get my head back into a free art mode.  
  
Music and art is a cliche, but it is my cliche (or possibly I am its).  
Dithering is the opposite of creative block, but in many ways even more destructive. At least with creative block you have to run with an idea when it comes up... :-)
