Furtherfield have published an essay by me on how digital artists can work to help improve Wikipedia's representation of digital art by becoming editors and participating in Wikipedia. There's been some good discussion of the article on mailing lists, and hopefully the article has demystified Wikipedia's editing process a bit for artists and encouraged people to get involved.

Wikipedians will notice a curious omission from the article - I don't mention NPOV. I did this deliberately as I didn't want to distract from discussion of the ideas that I have seen people on mailing lists having practical problems with. Which is why the article focusses on notability, sources and deletion. Hopefully it explains some of the rationale behind them and how to work with them to make better articles for Wikipedia, for society and for digital art.
