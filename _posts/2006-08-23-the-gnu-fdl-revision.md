Some details on the FDL revision from the second audio file linked from: [http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/6019](http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/6019%20)  


  
• 95% done.  


  
• 3 licenses, Russian-doll style.  


  
• A "simple fdl", for example for wikis.  


  
• BY-SA interoperability a goal. CC have been working with them on this.  


  
• No invariant clauses. This removes my only practical objection to compatibility!  


  
• Some ominous rumblings about flexible copyleft.
