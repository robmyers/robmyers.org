_The bloggers and surf clubs discussed at the Net Aesthetics 2.0 panel follow a similar model. But instead of stoically re-creating the art world online, they are opening themselves to a galaxy of experience that could potentially be considered art, while at the same time subversively slipping in their own content._  
- Tom Moody.  
  
_The solution to The Institutional Theory Of Art is to recognize artworks as members of the artworld_. - Rob Myers.  
  
_we would agree that the opacity of the aesthetic offers some much needed resistance to the kinds of transparency increasingly demanded in so-called "knowledge work"_ - Art & Language.
