"Our spaceships will have geometries which minimise frontal friction, channel incoming plasma flow into helical (centripedal) internal paths for burning, deflect external (centrifugal) paths for envelope-shaping, push against the background aether-field flow, and shield against internal radiation and magnetic accesses.  
We intend to share technology and resources rather than burn bridges. In space, nobody can hear you violate copyright.
