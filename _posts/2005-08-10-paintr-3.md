About paintr:  


  
Paintr was created by [Rob Myers](/). It was inspired by the writing of Harold Cohen and the projects of Pall Thayer.  
  
It is written in [PHP](http://www.php.net/), and uses several web services to gather and process aesthetic materials in order to create an analogue to art or artistic activity:
