I have uploaded the latest draw-something code to SourceForge CVS (as part of rob-art), and updated the rob-art website at [http://rob-art.sourceforge.net](http://rob-art.sourceforge.net).  
  
This version has a new drawing style system ("pen-parameters") and more extensive logging. Much refactoring was required by pen-parameters, which has made the code cleaner. And much debugging was enabled by the new logging, which has made the code faster and stabler.  
  
Grab a Lisp compiler, get the source and you can draw your own draw-something drawings, or have draw-something draw them for you.
