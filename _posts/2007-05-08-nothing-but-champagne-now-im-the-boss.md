"Man is born in freedom but he soon becomes a slaveIn cages of convention from the cradle to the graveThe weak fall by the wayside but the strong will be savedIn a brave new world."- The Artilleryman, "Jeff Waynes Musical Version Of War Of the Worlds".There's something wonderful about summing up everything that went wrong with the 20th century because of 19th century ideology in less than one verse. The Artilleryman's description of his plan to the Journalist is wonderful because it makes clear the seductive logic of historicism in a way that invokes both communism and fascism equally.The title of this post is something else the Artilleryman says. It's funnier if you say it while opening a bottle of the cheapest cava.
