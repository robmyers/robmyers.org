I think these are going to be about everything that's wrong about "Relational Aesthetics".  


  
Self-managerial drawings playing with scale and other transformations, self-similar and enabled to expand their extents. Not as a dreary "questioning of originality" (a Romantic notion in itself)), as what is required of drawing, and what drawing requires.
