Most AI art producers begin from a model of child art.   
Children's art is knowledge-based, figure based, and emergent (unplanned).   
In contrast, an "adult" (professional) figurative artist is observation-based, balances positive and negative space, and works on the composition before the content of the work.  
A program that worked in this way would pre-scan the picture plane and tag its elements (pixels or pre-generated polygons) with relational information:  
• close to the edge, centre, top, bottom, left, right  
• on the edge of the picture plane  
• proximity to other elements  
• relative size  
• formal qualities (jagged, smooth, triangular, square)  
The next stage of the program can then work with a richer environment.  
Embody compositional principles: golden sections, horizontal/vertical/diagonal, ground/sky line, etc.  
Valence the plane, valence the compositional principles, then build the composition.   
Give equal weight to figure and ground, to positive and negative space.  
This is a technical exercise, but figure/ground relations are important in art. The boundary or distribution of shapes must be aesthetically interesting in some extra-aesthetic way. This sounds like "No Logo" or philosophy/business theory.
