The bestest quote on 'Pataphysics is by Jack Kerouac:  
  
_I even plunge into all the books and magazines around, I read up on "Pataphysics and yell contemptuously in the lamplight " "T'sa'n intellectual excuse for facetious joking, " throwing the magazine away, adding 'Peculiarly attractive to certain shallow types"_
