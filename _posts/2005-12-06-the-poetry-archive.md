There's a lovely disclaimer on the legal page to the effect that the freedom of  
  
expression found in poetry may offend some people and that if it does they  
  
should get over it. :-)  


  
The legal page also asserts copyright over all the recordings. Even if some of  
  
the older recordings were out of copyright, I'm guessing very few of the actual  
  
poems would be. Any poetry experts on the list? :-)  


  
Wonder if they would consider CC-NC?
