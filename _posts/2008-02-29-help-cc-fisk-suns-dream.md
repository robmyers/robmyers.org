[Is it possible to design non-defective DRM? - Creative Commons](http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8080)  
  


<blockquote>_If not and admittedly, we suspect this is the case, all the more reason to hasten the abandonment of DRM and the hindrance it poses to innovation, and to embrace technologies that make content more useful and empower users._</blockquote>

  
  
CC are cool, and they've handled this very diplomatically.  
  
DRM is [defective by design](http://defectivebydesign.org/). You can have Fair Use, or you can have DRM.  
  
Rather than shunning Sun's snake oil let's take this as an opportunity to show, once and for all, that DRM is legally, technologically and probably mathematically incompatible with the Fair Use that has driven demand for Sun's servers during the Internet era.  
  
Please forward CC's post as broadly as possible and get every DRM and Fair Use expert you can contact aware of this.
