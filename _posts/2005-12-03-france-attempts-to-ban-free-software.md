_France may soon enact the worst copyright law in Europe, sneaking it through in a legislative session scheduled for December 22 and 23_

_Friday November 18th, 2005, French Department of Culture. SNEP and SCPP have told Free Software authors: "You will be required to change your licenses." SACEM add: "You shall stop publishing free software," and warn they are ready "to sue free software authors who will keep on publishing source code" should the "VU/SACEM/BSA/FA Contents Department"[1] bill proposal pass in the Parliament._

**Please sign the petition against this**:  


  
[http://eucd.info/petitions/index.php?petition=2](http://eucd.info/petitions/index.php?petition=2)  


  
Here's a machine translation of the petition, which is in French of course:_  
_

  
By this petition, I thus ask you solemnly:  
  
- to withdraw the bill nÂ° 1206 on the royalty of the parliamentary agenda;  
  
- to organize a true debate between the parts concerned aiming at finding a real balance, and where associations of authors and users of free software, librarians, and Net surfers will be able to really take part;  
  
- to make so that the requests in particular initiative EUCD.INFO and interassociation of the archivists, librarians and documentalists (http://droitauteur.levillage.org) are taken into account.  


  
By signing this petition, I join the many organizations which are opposed clearly to the provisions of this bill and to the conditions of its development.
