That was terrible.  
  
It couldn't have been worse if they'd given the Dalek a baseball cap.  
  
Yes, it tied into lots of old stuff and was a good basic idea. Production was good (apart from the usual crap music). Doctor slipped a bit, Rose good as ever.  
  
But a single Dalek, a floaty Dalek, and a melancholy Dalek, doesn't work. And a cute litle dalek enjoying a moment of sunshine **_really_** doesn't work. Dredd doesn't remove his helmet, a Dalek doesn't pop its top off...  
  
Not so much an opportunity missed as one surrounded by glowing craters.
