[What is the best Free Culture license? at Understanding](http://understandinglimited.com/2007/03/27/licensefun/)  
  
_I'm not sure what the best free non-software license is. That is, a license that respects the public's freedom for things which are software, but not functional software - a digital manual for a program, not the program software itself, for example._  
  
_I'm sure who writes the most popular licenses used in this way is, though: Creative Commons._
