I stumbled over this anti-face-recognition project again and, post-"[world's ugliest t-shirt](http://www.viceland.com/blogs/en/2010/09/03/william-gibson/2/)" from "[Zero History](http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/books/zero_history.asp)" I enjoyed it even more:

This technique can work in reverse, causing false positives and misdirected automated actions:

And it can use objects other than faces, operating on sensors other than 2D cameras:

When more and more human activity is being structured and quantized to make machine processing easier, aesthetics can disrupt this.




"...the opacity of the aesthetic offers some much needed resistance to the kinds of transparency increasingly demanded..."
