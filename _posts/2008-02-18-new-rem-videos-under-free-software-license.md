[R.E.M. Releases New Videos Under Open Source License - ReadWriteWeb](http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/rem_releases_new_videos_under_open_source_license.php)  
  


<blockquote>_R.E.M. today released 11 videos for the first song from their forthcoming album, all in MP4 format in HD and under an open source license. "Supernatural Serious," is the first single from the bands next album, "Accelerate," due to be released April 1st._</blockquote>

  
  
They've used a software licence, the Perl Artistic License Version 2, rather than a cultural works licence such as CC-BY. Which is a strange choice but it is a Free licence so woohoo!
