I gave a talk about [Minara](http://minara.sourceforge.net/) to around 100 people on Monday at [Dorkbot London 33.](http://www.dorkbot.org/dorkbotlondon/20051121.html)

People asked questions and I managed to recode the window creation in the two minutes I had between the previous talk and my one. I feel that both these facts show I'm on to something. :-)  


  
No more Minara hacking until April now, when it's time to tackle picking.  


  
Dorkbot London is absolutely amazing. Alex and Saul have created something wonderful.
