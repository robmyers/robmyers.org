[UK blogs, boards, Web 2.0 sites: how to not get sued - A Consuming Experience](http://www.consumingexperience.com/2008/01/uk-blogs-boards-web-20-sites-how-to-not.html).  
  
Improbulus's notes on a talk about UK blogging law fromÂ  Robert ands of Finers Stephen Innocent, and his slides.  
  
Close to a UK equivalent of the EFF Blogger's guide, which is more US-specific.  
  
[Update] MJ Ray in the comments points out that the blog and notes are NC and the slides are all rights reserved. Sorry about that. I've suggested a freely licenced version to ORG, and Francis Davey seems interested. Email them and let them know it's a good idea...
