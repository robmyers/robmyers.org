You've got you MacBook Pro and you've taken a break from the conference to have a tall skinny decaf latte and listen to some music while you update your blog on the free wifi. You hipster, you. Could you be any cooler? Well, yes.  
  
Your iPod and your iTunes library are proprietary software and closed formats. They are limiting your freedom. But there's a Free alternative.  
  
Ogg Vorbis is an MP3/MP4 replacement. You can use it in iTunes and on music players, so it isn't inconvenient, and unlike MP3/MP4 it is Free and doesn't limit your freedom. It sounds good too.
