Due to an unlikely series of events I'm going to be in Boston and Cambridge, Massachusetts from Friday 20th to Monday 23rd of March. Amongst other things I'll be at the FSF's [Libre Planet](http://www.fsf.org/associate/meetings/2009/) conference.  
  
If you'll be in the area or at the convention you can contact me using the comments here, identi.ca, twitter, facebook or email where I am always "robmyers", although for email you need to add rob@ ... .org .  
  
And if you won't be in the area but you've any questions regarding network service freedom or the FSF's high priority projects add them in the comments.
