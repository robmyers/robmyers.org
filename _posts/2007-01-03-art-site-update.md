[my new art site](/art/)I've updated the pages of the art section of my site to use a new modern gallery system with on-page image slideshows rather than pop-up windows (not the index page yet).Take a look. The downloads have been consolidated to just SVG and the license for work is still BY-SA 2.5 . Ignore what some of the older archives say.The pages are generated by a Python script I've written and the slideshow system is Gallery2. Non-JavaScript users will get the same image linking they've always had.Let me know what you think of the new system, it's easy enough to rebuild the site if something looks bad or doesn't work quite right.
