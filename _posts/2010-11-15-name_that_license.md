When you are blogging, tweeting, denting, or otherwise writing about a Creative Commons licensed work, please always state the actual licence rather than just saying "Creative Commons licensed" or "under a Creative Commons license".  
  
If the work's license is important enough to mention, it's worth mentioning the actual license.For people who know the licenses it helps to frame their expectations for the work, and for those who don't it helps educate them about the different licences. If space is short, CC-NC-ND is shorter than "a Creative Commons Licence".  
  
So state the actual licence and help inform and educate people about which Creative Commons licenses works are actually under.  
  
Thank you! :-)
