A comment from Alan Sutcliffe on the various names for art-made-with-computers (private email) got me thinking. Procedural art (Alan's term) is a good description. I quite like the term I've now come up with: art computing. It describes the process and the activity, implying that something might come out of it rather than being a (dead) end in itself.
