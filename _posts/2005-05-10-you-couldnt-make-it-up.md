Update: Post pulled due to original story being fake. Whoops.  
  
Update: Now I'm totally confused. I'll update this when I know what's going on. We'll see whether this post's title was right or not. :-)  
  
Update: Right, story checking policy.  
  
1. Check the original page, read all of it, check the design.  
2. Check the site, evaluate the site name, read the front, about and copyright pages.  
3. Google the site name and get the WHOIS information for the domain.  
4. Google the author name.  
5. If any of this causes you to think that the story might be a joke or a plant, drop it and inform your source.  
  
Do this for any funny, ironic or major stories.
