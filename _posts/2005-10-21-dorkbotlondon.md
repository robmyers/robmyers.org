I spoke at [dorkbotlondon](http://dorkbot.org/dorkbotlondon/) last night.  


  
There were thirty five people in the audience. They listened and then asked questions (not all of them) and had good suggestions to make about [draw-something](http://rob-art.sourceforge.net/) and [paintr](http://paintr.robmyers.org/).  


  
Dorkbot is amazing. Hopefully I'll be able to get to the next one. I may do an opendork about [minara](http://minara.sourceforge.net/) .
