[Old Time Out article on the Strange Attractions shop](http://www.chaos-works.com/strange_attractions.html)  
  


<blockquote>_Strange Attractions is a freaky new "sort of front-line cultural science centre cum fractal_art/boutique" in Kensington Park Road, Portobello_</blockquote>

  
  
Or was in 1991. I used to make my way there to get fractal stuff in the early 1990s. Well, it was generally 2 or 3 dimensional, but it had images of fractals on it. I never got any of the music. I must try to find some.  
  
I've a soft spot for fractals. I'll write about why another time.
