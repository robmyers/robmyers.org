Parahash is a command line tool written that titles paragraphs with their hashes (and the entire document with the hash of those hashes). It handles a subset of Markdown and tries to ignore formatting that shouldn't effect the identity of the text (extra whitespace, emphasis, hyperlinks).

You can control the represention and length of the hash, so:

    Paragraph one.

    Second paragraph.

    Final paragraph.

can become anything from:

    # f104ee138a2cf14e5af642647c7f28111240c66ebee50e00c222a9a435c12e40
    
    ## dbcba560ab93aa79c7e358a69848177ed0b52365f631c40ca4db070a2e319e96
    
    Paragraph one.
    
    ## 3fc3deaa2b3609eb7d096478e4e522fc071348be1b8e116ce204cff63c08af80
    
    Second paragraph.
    
    ## 5b8a59d072daef094e33b457e9638b8dd46de361db618e1baac29ce7b31259b5
    
    Final paragraph.

to:

    # hahaz-gimuv-somom-vajaz-kuroj-honah-zudul-dibof
    
    ## razot-bojip-givop-nunop
    
    Paragraph one.
    
    ## gazug-poput-kusof-rolob
    
    Second paragraph.
    
    ## pavoj-biloj-piral-nasuv
    
    Final paragraph.

Why would you want to do this? Well, it's more useful than numbering them. ;-)
