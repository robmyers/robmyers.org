Cover by ROMAN DIRGE. Story by ROMAN DIRGE.  
  
Interior art by mistake. It looks like someone has just discovered the airbrush tool in Photoshop. "Hey! Let's smear indistinct greys around with no regard for light sources, shapes, textures or different brush sizes!" It is embarrassingly bad art. No, it's not atmospheric. Not unless the atmosphere smells strongly of methane.  
  
But the cover and pre-order sheets say ROMAN DIRGE. Not REMEDIAL PHOTOSHOP AIRBRUSH STUDENT. ROMAN DIRGE.  
  
So it'll sell a few copies and piss a lot of people off. Including any comic shop owners who feel they've been mis-sold the damn thing when it turns up in this week's orders.  
  
If this was a media blog I'd now produce some profound insight into how this is an example of how not to squander the relational capital that artists build up with their audience. But it isn't, so I won't.
