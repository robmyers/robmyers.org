Prolog is good for representing and dealing with facts and rules, and it's good at working with tree and graph structures. Prolog should be used for graphics and art a lot more than it is (my current project "Got To Start Somewhere" is written in Prolog, as was the original version of "The Cybernetic Artwork Nobody Wrote"):

[A simple model of narrative](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/user/michaelm/www/nidocs/Lang.pdf) (expressed in Prolog).
