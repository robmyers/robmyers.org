Two "Open" literary projects.  
  
NewsGrist on an author opening up some of his stories for playwrights:  
  
[Jonathan Lethem Goes Open Source](http://newsgrist.typepad.com/underbelly/2007/01/jonathan_lethem.html)  
  
It's an excellent move. Why he isn't using a CC licence is beyond me, though.  
  
And Penguin Books are experimenting with writing a book through a wiki:  
  
[A Million Penguins ](http://thepenguinblog.typepad.com/the_penguin_blog/2007/02/a_million_pengu.html)  
  
Ghost authorship, multiple authorship and finishing services for books are common, and movie & TV scripts are written by teams, so with a good model to follow there is no reason why novels shouldn't be written by a competent team.  
  
Wikipedia would be a terrible model for writing a book, a giant uncoordinated game of Exquisite Corpse.  
  
The Linux Kernel would be an excellent model for writing a book. Competent contributors working to an understood design with their contributions being audited and accepted or rejected by competent integrators.
