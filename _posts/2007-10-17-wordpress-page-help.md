I am trying to add some pages to this blog but they are not showing up.  
  
For example: [/weblog/free-culture-greatest-hits/](/weblog/free-culture-greatest-hits/)  
  
Is there something I need to do to my blog or web server settings, could this be a plugin acting up, or is it likely that I've misconfigured something somewhere?  
  
Any help gratefully received.
