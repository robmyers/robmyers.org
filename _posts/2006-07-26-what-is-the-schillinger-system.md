[What Is The Schillinger System](http://www.schillingersystem.com/whatis.htm)  
  
_The idea behind the Schillinger System is simple and inevitable: it undertakes the application of mathematical logic to all the materials of music and to their functions_  
  
And to art as well (in "The Mathematical Basis Of The Arts"). A complete mathematical system for composition from the mid 20th Century.
