Imagine a horror film about an insane ventriloquist who believes that his possessed dummy is talking. What he believes the dummy to be saying is not what the dummy is saying. The dummy can appeal to the audience, but the ventriloquist will not understand the audience's reactions. Especially when the dummy tells the audience that the ventriloquist thinks it wants him to murder his wife.  


  
How can the ventriloquist silence the dummy? Even if he destroys it or exorcises it he will only silence its real voice. He will still hear what he thinks it is saying. And if his insanity is diagnosed and treated after this, he will still be unaware of what he has actually done.
