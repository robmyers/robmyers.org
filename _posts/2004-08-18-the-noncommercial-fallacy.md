(from cc-license-discuss)  
  
1. NC stops anyone who uses the work from making money off of it.  
2. The internet service providers, software and hardware companies, internet hosts and print shops that are involved in the creation of the work still make money off of it.  
3. The warm glow of anti-capitalist virtue people get from NC is therefore self-defeating. They are giving money to commercial interests without taking anything back from them. Which is better, subsidising commerce a little or getting it to open some of its content in return for using yours?
