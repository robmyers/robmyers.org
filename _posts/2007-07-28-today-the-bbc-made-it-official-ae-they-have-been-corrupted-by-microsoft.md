Today the BBC made it official -- they have been corrupted by Microsoft.With today's launch of the iPlayer, the BBC Trust has failed in its most basic of duties and handed over to Microsoft sole control of the on-line distribution of BBC programming. From today, you will need to own a Microsoft operating system to view BBC programming on the web.****** [http://www.defectivebydesign.org/blog/BBCcorrupted](http://www.defectivebydesign.org/blog/BBCcorrupted) *******Please Digg: [http://tinyurl.com/3dzo57](http://tinyurl.com/3dzo57)Please Reddit: [http://reddit.com/info/2a0qt/](http://reddit.com/info/2a0qt/)Also, if you're in the North of England and would be interested ina potential protest at BBC Manchester on the same day, please considering joining 'Manchester Free Software'.
