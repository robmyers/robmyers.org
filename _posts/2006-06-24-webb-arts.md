[WEBB ARTS](http://webbarts.blogspot.com/)  
  
_For many years I have been making things…small sculptured heads, masks, jewelry, drums, etc….which appear to be artifacts (fetishes, totems, allies) from some primitive tribal culture. The materials and techniques used to make the objects are both ancient (bones, stones, horn, hand-shaping, chipping, cutting etc.) and high tech (acrylic polymer clay and paint, digital scanning and image manipulation, archival Ultrachrome printing, etc.). People who have seen these objects cannot put their finger on what part of the world or time period they may be from, and I have not attempted to copy artifacts I might have seen from any particular culture or period. The only way that I can account for the nature of this "evidence" is to say that it has simply emerged from some imaginal region and time._
