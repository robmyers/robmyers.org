"Frieze" ran an article on "Lomography" some time ago, concluding that  
however designerish "Lomo" photographers may feel they're being they  
are still producing Lomo-aesthetic images (see  
[http://www.lomography.org](http://www.lomography.org) for why). But this is true of any  
fixed-focus or special-effect camera, from the Box Brownie through  
1950s corrective-lens-and-filter cameras, "Polaroids", 110s,  
lenticular print cameras, fixed-lens digital cameras and Lomo's  
multi-lens or coloured-flash cameras. Lomo just try to make it a  
virtue.  
  
There's a name for the self-similar photography of the tourist and the  
partygoer: The Snapshot Aesthetic. Partly due to the  
would-be-photographer trying to realise pre-existent image models,  
partly because of the constraints of the media, things always seem to  
come out a certain way in snapshots.  
  
The Snapshot Aesthetic casts its shadows from the platonic realm into  
the real world like a brand or a religion, actualised by anyone  
without an SLR. It is therefore generative, an engine with input,  
output and an aesthetic transformation between the two. Describing The  
Snapshot Aesthetic in this way is not an after-the-fact switch of  
description and prescription - snapshots are still being taken and are  
most likely becoming more like snapshots as time goes on.  
  
This may seem a strangely destructive generativity, one that limits  
the space of images rather than extending it. But this is true of any  
aesthetic - an aesthetic is a set of constraints on production. The  
imposition of constraints limits, but it also directs and  
focusses. Infinite choice would take infinite time and have infinitely  
dissipate meaning so constraining the choice space is good. Art  
without constraints is not possible, but art without knowledge of its  
constraints is kitsch.
