One advantage of using programs to make art is that the results are "proofs" of the theory of artistic production embodied in the program. Like the proofs of a mathematical theory, or the proofs of an etching. Or like an aesthetic Turing test, if a human being can't tell the difference between a drawing made by a program and one made by another human being, the program has been proven to be successfully reproducing a human level of artistic production.
