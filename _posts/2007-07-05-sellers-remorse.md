Dave Winer placed one of the RSS specs under a CC Licence.  
  
Now he wants to stop one particular group producing a revised spec.  
  
So he's asking how to do this, phrasing it as a dispute about a work under the license.  
  
Modulo moral rights you can't control how people use the work. And even if you could, they could just produce a new document for the spec.  
  
This isn't a problem with the licences. It's a social issue.
