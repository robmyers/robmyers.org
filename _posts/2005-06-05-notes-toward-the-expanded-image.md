images are representation (Wark) is query (Google) is search (AI) is culling (shape grammars)  


  
an image is not a degenerate text, such claims are ideology  


  
a bicycle is multi-dimensional (flatterland). projection (rendering) is reduction of dimensions through transformations. an image is a projection. a picture or a painting is not necessarily an image.  


  
is a unicycle a reduced-dimension projection of a bicycle, an image of a bicycle? :-)  


  
images, projections are indexical, if lossy. transformation, if lossy.  


  
performance, installation, social action may be images.  


  
images are aesthetic (indexical ideological choices).  


  
Adornian aesthetic isomorphism. indices, indexing  


  
quantization, search, query, state-space, dimensions, discrete/continuous, syntactic field.
