<strike>_There's no evidence to show that "piracy" hurts artists' incomes._</strike>  
  
<strike>So of course:</strike>  
  
_<strike>  BloodSpell is released under a "Creative Commons Attribution, No Commercial Use" License.</strike> _  
  
<strike>That clear? Piracy doesn't hurt, so they are releasing the work under a NonCommercial licence. Excuse me whilst I fire up my Che Guevara t-shirt.</strike>  
  
Update: Bloodspell's makers tell me that they don't have a licence from Bioware, who make the software they use, to release their work commercially. Since the work is a movie/video, I'm guessing this has more to do with the assets than the engine (it's Neverwinter Nights). But that explains the NC license. And makes it cool that they got it.  
  
I will now do my people's traditional dance of apology and offer various sacrifices to [Strange Company](http://www.strangecompany.org/).
