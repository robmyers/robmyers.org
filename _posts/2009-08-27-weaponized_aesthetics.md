I've been looking for examples of offensive (as in attacking) military use of aesthetics. Dazzle ships and pop music torture are all I can find so far. The IDF's use of Situationist theory comes close.  
  
In literature there are examples such as the hypnomats Jerry Cornelius's father built into his fake Le Corbusier Chateau in "The Final Programme" by Michale Moorcock or the free-will-destroyingly addictive entertainment of "Infinite Jest" by David Foster Wallace.  
  
I think I'm relieved that I can't find more real-life examples, but I'd be interested to hear if anybody knows of any more.
