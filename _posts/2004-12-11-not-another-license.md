[The Open Art License](http://three.org/openart/)[ ](http://artlibre.org/licence.php/lalgb.html), by the [Open Art Network](http://three.org/openart/). I don't think we need another art license. If people want a GPL-style license for art, one that requires that sources be provided, they should probably just use the GPL. [GnuArt](http://www.gnuart.org/) do this. If you don't want to provide sources, the [Creative Commons](http://www.creativecommons.org/) licenses are best. There have been other attempts at art licenses. The [Free Art License](http://artlibre.org/licence.php/lalgb.html) has been out for a while now, and I drafted (but fortunately never used) a [BSD-style art license](http://homepage.mac.com/robmyers/weblog/C1592552572/E436023289/index.html) a few years back.  
  
Let's not divide culture up into little content ghettos around strangely similar yet strangely incompatible licenses.
