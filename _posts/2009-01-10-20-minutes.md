[Over at Locus](http://www.locusmag.com/Features/2009/01/cory-doctorow-writing-in-age-of.html), Cory has a good article on how to write a novel a year despite the joys of the internet and looking after a baby.  
  
The point of my (abandoned) "agile art" series was to apply geek productivity techniques to some aspects of art production. And several of my recent projects have been structured to be produced as many small, quickly produced works. You can't do every project that way, and the projects I couldn't structure in that way have tended not to get finished.  
  
Cory's observation that you can write a page in 20 minutes and you can always find 20 minutes a day has some bearing on drawing and blogging. So I'm going to make sure I find 20 minutes a day for them...
