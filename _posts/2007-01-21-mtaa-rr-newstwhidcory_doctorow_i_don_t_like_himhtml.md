MTAA rather miss the point of Cory Doctorow and his comments on the Cloud Gate fiasco.  
Calling for an Anish Kapoor sculpture to be melted down for scrap is usually the sign of a healthy mind. Unless it's one of his powderier confections, obviously. Anyone who finds calling for the destruction of an artwork disturbing really needs to read up on their art history beyond The Culture Wars.  
Calling for an Anish Kapoor sculpture to be melted down for scrap in the course of a battle over public space and representation, issues that are key to art and society, is  
simply a rhetorical expression of strongly held opinion over those issues. And as someone who cares passionately about art, I would say in all seriousness that if a work of art is that harmful to society (in a practical rather than a symbolic way), destroying it is the less harmful option for art itself.
