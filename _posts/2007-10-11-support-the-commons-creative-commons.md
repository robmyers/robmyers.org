[Support the Commons | Creative Commons](http://support.creativecommons.org/)  
  
Please help Creative Commons in their annual funding drive.  
  
I have put time and money into supporting CC over the last few years (I'm not just a mailing-list-activist) because they are doing something positive for Free Culture. So if you are not a fan of NC and ND, and I'm certainly not, don't let that stop you supporting SA.  
  
I got a letter from Lessig suggesting some good ways to support the funding drive (centred around the theme of "five") but I can't find a copy online. Does anyone know if it's out there anywhere? Lessig suggests:  
  


  

  * Using 5 CC licenced works.
  

  * Licencing 5 new works  (I say make them BY-SA!)
  

  * Introducing 5 new people to Creative Commons.
  

  * Giving 50% more to CC this year than you did last year
  
  
  
And spreading the campaign, which I'm doing here.  
  
Support CC!
