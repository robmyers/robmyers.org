As I was getting on the bus to dash home from work and collect my son from nursery, the driver saw my "Creative Commies" badge and asked what it was.  


  
Which led to a discussion about copyright and music.  


  
I talked about how the artist whose show I went to see at PDA the other week had to change her work two weeks before the show because of copyright concerns, mentioned the Bridgeport/Dimension decision, and how culture always builds on other culture.  


  
He talked about George Harrison, how many bars of a song you can use before licensing, and FACT's claims that illegal copying funds organised crime, before concluding that the record companies are a form of organised crime anyway. :-)
