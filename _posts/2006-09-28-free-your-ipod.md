Free your iPod! [iPodLinux](http://www.ipodlinux.org/) or [Rockbox](http://www.rockbox.org/) are both Free operating systems for iPods. iPodLinux is easier to install and supports all your existing software but may not handle as many formats. Rockbox is harder to install but supports more free formats and a wider range of players.  
  
So there really is no excuse for not having Free Software on your iPod.  
  
Thanks to [Matt Lee](http://comedynetuk.com/) for suggesting Rockbox to me!
