Last night I realised that Daniel Buren's stripes are ideal reference for the next set of Titled images. Squares, boxes, zips, and now stripes. Looking at the Buchmann Galerie site today, Lawrence Weiner's graphic conceptual text might make good source material for the project as well, taking it in a new direction.
