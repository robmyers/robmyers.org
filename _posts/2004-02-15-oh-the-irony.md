Compare the figures in a Maloney painting to the figures in an AARON painting. AARON is working hard to reach this state, Maloney is dumbing down to it. AAARON comes from a fondness for painting, figures, and art. I don't really care where Maloney is coming from. Both ironise the figure through technique, yet 's cack-handedness tells us much less about people at the end of the twentieth century than AARON.   
It's the difference between Nu Metal's not-knowing-enough-to-cover-its-ineptness signifying and electronic music, where you have to find your own soul if any. This potential for representing, ironically, humanity is becoming one of the main things that interests me in making art with technology
