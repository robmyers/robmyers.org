Very, very good.  
  
Some guitar, some synth, some nods to classic New Order songs, some side-project riffs, some awkward lyrics, and some songs that you'll be haunted by before they hit their first chorus.  
  
Much, much better than "Get Ready", and much better than the more anally retentive reviewers have hinted. This will be your summer and your autumn, too.  
  
Highly recommended.
