Digging through my archives I found an unfinished license drafted for an abandoned project from 2001 which I present here for your amusement. It's inspired by the BSD and OGL licenses. IANAL so don't try to actually use it - you wouldn't try to use heart transplant instructions written by an artist would you? :-)
