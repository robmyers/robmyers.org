Some of my earliest work was remixing images. I went round the studios at KIAD asking people if I could photograph their work, and made images by sampling the results.   
Now it's possible to [search for Creative Commons licensed work](http://creativecommons.org/getcontent/) by license and type, I can find more images to sample. I'm starting to get a remixing itch that I may have to scratch soon. :-)
