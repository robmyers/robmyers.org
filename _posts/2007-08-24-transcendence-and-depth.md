_The whole point is that there is no depth, and depth is just another name - treasured by the hermeneuts - for transcendence._

_Where does a truth come from then, if its process is strictly immanent and it is not given as the secret depth or intimate essence of the situation? [...] it has its origins in a disappearance._

- Alain Badiou, Theoretical Writings, p122

Badiou is fascinating for his genuinely atheistic philosophy built on the infinities of set theory. He's a Lacanian but we won't mention that.
