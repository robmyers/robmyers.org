"Like That" turned into a code generation project but I think this was more trouble than it was worth. Beware the seduction of time-saving code that doesn't save time. I took the "make a large number of exhibitable works" part and missed out the "quickly" part. And I ended up having to exercise editorial control, and Processing isn't the right environment for it, and it didn't make doing the hard things any easier, and so I got discouraged.  
  
So I'm going to roll back "Like That" to the hand-written works, re-make some of the more interesting generated works, and try to push on into the areas I wanted to go but that the code generator made difficult to do.  
  
Now I just need to rescue that work and put it back on the restored web site...
