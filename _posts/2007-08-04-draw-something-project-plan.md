Here are my current plans for draw-something. They are subject to change.  
  
1. Relicence as GPL 3. **_Done._**  
  
2. Ensure that colouring code works properly.  
- Check that it matches Cohen's description.  
- Do this in chordinator?  
  
3. Tune up "Interesting Points" system.  
- Make 100 images and try to code away unpleasant features.  
  
4. Finish basic simple & large -> complex & small figure plane system.  
  
5. Move to more complex "figures & developments" system.  
  
6. More figure types.  
- Currently there are polylines, polygons and hulls.  
- Add points, circles, arcs, linesets, circlesets.  
  
7. Switch to integer maths or at least whole-pixel offsets.  
- Error based line drawing?  
  
9. Relational groups.  
- Literal mirror, scale, rotate of core skeleton.  
- Conceptual groups e.g. "5 points", "all same size/area".  
  
10. Tagging scheme.  
- Tag interesting points to get clusters, relations.  
- Tag each development to guide later developments.  
- Basic implimenteation e.g. plist of symbols.  
  
  
A. Solve presentation problem.  
- Do it like current AARON or like Copycat, drawing screen & log screen.  
- Ltk seems best bet.  
- Dump drawing and commentary as event log to (e.g.) Java based player.  
  
B. Make sketch program & development program & colour program?  
- UNIX pipeline.  
- Make each component simpler.  
- Like Kazushi's systems.  
  
C. Representational imagery?  
  
D. Pixmap/crop-based system or faster vector-based hit testing? (See 7.)  
  
E. Stop using CVS? Just release tarballs?
