**Ipsy Dipsy.**  


  
Ipsy dipsy, baby and me,  
  
Making castles by the sea.  
  
Ipsy dipsy, seagulls fly,  
  
Over the castles in the sky.  
  
Ipys dipsy, baby and me,  
  
Eating strawberries for our tea.  
  
Ipsy dipsy, that was fun,  
  
And now it's over and our day's done.  


  
**Sleepy Time For Babies.**  


  
Sleepy time for babies,  
  
Babies time for sleep.  
  
Slumber in your cradle,  
  
Slumber do not weep.  
  
It is time for sleeping,  
  
Sleepy time for you.  
  
It is time for sleeping,  
  
That's what you must do.  


  
**I Don't Know.**  


  
I don't know, the fireman said,  
  
Our fire engine should be red.  
  
The funniest thing I've ever seen,  
  
Is somebody's come and painted it green.  


  
**Counting Bears.**  


  
Counting bears is easy.  
  
What you have to do,  
  
Is mix their honey,  
  
Up with glue.  
  
The bears eat the honey,  
  
And stick to the pot.  
  
Counting bears is easy,  
  
But they do get cross  


  
**Lions.**  


  
One lion, two lions, three lions, four,  
  
Five lions, six lions, seven lions, ROAR!
