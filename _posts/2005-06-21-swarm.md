Cool work by Tom Moody, and images of how it was made:

I like the technique used to make the image (repeated printing, alteration, scanning and retouching). Using the computer as part of an ongoing, iterative, creative process.  


  
**Update (27/06/05):** [Tom says](http://www.digitalmediatree.com/tommoody/?32426) it was overprinting and an X-acto knife rather than rescanning. Which is even cooler. :-)
