In January [the sources for Goto 10's "Floss+Art" book](http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4671426/FLOSS_Art_v1.1) were released, which feature the expanded version of my essay "Open Source Art Again".

In March I went to [the FSF's "Libre Planet" conference](http://www.fsf.org/associate/meetings/2009/), which was great. Thanks to Mako for the sofa!

In December I went to [Goto 10's "Make Art" conference](http://goto10.org/make-art-2009/) to talk about Foocorp's [libre.fm](http://libre.fm/) project, which went live in April.

[Furtherfield](http://www.furtherfield.org/) continued to publish [my reviews](http://www.furtherfield.org/display_user.php?ID=467). I find writing reviews very hard, and it's always good when I get feedback, I think my most popular review on that basis was [the one of Pall Thayer's excellent Microcodes.](http://www.furtherfield.org/displayreview.php?review_id=337)

CIAC published some [different](http://www.ciac.ca/magazine/archives/no_33/oeuvre4.htm) [reviews](http://www.ciac.ca/magazine/archives/no_34/oeuvre5.htm), which gave me a good chance to review work I wouldn't have had a chance to otherwise.

And I finished a good number of projects, including [The Cybernetic Artworld](/art/cybernetic_artworld/), [The Colour Of News](/the_colour_of_news), [The Colour Of](/the_colour_of), the code for the [Demo Graphic Replicators](http://www.demographicreplicator.com/), and [Random Aesthetics](/art/random_aesthetics).

A big thank you to everyone whose material and moral support made this all possible. I feel very lucky to have got to do so much good stuff this year. I hope to do even more next year.
