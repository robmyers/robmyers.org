Would you like to be a GNU webmaster? Let me know if you would. I'm now the chief GNU webmaster. We need more webmasters.  
  
I've been coding for various art projects, writing and drawing (yay!) furiously and reviewing books for Furtherfield. The drawings are mostly for a project of imagined Rothko paintings inspired by recent reports that some of his work was hung the wrong way up at the Tate...  
  
I had a great time at a party at the HTTP gallery on Saturday, talking to lots of interesting people about art, games, new media and old television shows. I don't know how the old television shows got in there.  
  
But all of this leaves very little time for blogging...
