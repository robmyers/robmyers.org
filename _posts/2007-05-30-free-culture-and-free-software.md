Free Software as described by Stallman comes from the fact that software  is functional, it is basically a machine. A novel, a play, a painting or  a concerto are not functional, they are not machines. So we cannot use  the same arguments that Stallman advances for software, and the freedoms  are not necessarily the same. For cultural artefacts represented as  software, Stallman's freedoms do apply but this is because the work is  software. The claims of some artists that blahblahblah do not change this.  
  
For cultural work in general you do actually need very similar freedoms  to those that you need for software. This is partly an accident (source  code is regarded as literary work for the purposes of copyright) and  partly because public culture in an open society must not close off  comment, critique, study or succession. This requires that you be free  to analyse, copy and modify the work.  
  
The minimal freedom that you need for cultural works is Extended Fair  Use (XFU) as described by Negativland. I think that Stallman and Lessig  agree on this despite Stallman's writing about functional, opinion and  expressive works (Stallman's simple "you can copy this essay unmodified"  license should make its support for Fair Use explicit). Copyleft is a  superset of XFU, it gives you all the freedom of XFU and more, but it  frightens the horses economically speaking.  
  
I agree that it does not make sense to try to live on Free Culture  alone. Reform is needed in the mainstream, we cannot reproduce the last  70 years of culture in the way that the GNU project has recreated a  functional equivalent of UNIX. There is no functional equivalency in  culture, and there is no way we can catch up on seventy years worth of  work in every medium rather than fifteen years worth of work in a single  medium (as UNIX was in 1984). It is very important to lobby for legal  reform in the name of Free Culture.  
  
But this does not make alternative licenses useless by any means. We can  use Free Software's tactic of producing a free alternative in order to  place pressure on a proprietary project could be effective. The  existence of a pool of self-identified freedom can show the need for  broader freedom when lobbying. And it may be ethical to produce one's  own work with the freedom that one would wish to enjoy generally.
