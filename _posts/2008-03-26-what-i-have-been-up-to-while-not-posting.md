Last Monday, Dave Bausola and I were interviewed by Suw Charman about "Where Are The Joneses?" as part of ORG's Creative Business In The Digital Age event.  That's me on the right of the photo, holding the talking stick.  
  
It was an excellent event and I recommend you take a look both at the[ photos](http://www.flickr.com/photos/marchankins/sets/72157604184001350/) and at the [web site](http://www.openrightsgroup.org/creativebusiness/index.php/Main_Page) which has lots of handy resources.  
  
I will get around to posting about WRTJ? at length soon...  
  
(Update 26/3/08: [Dave has blogged about the event as well](http://zeroinfluence.wordpress.com/2008/03/26/the-open-rights-group-make-a-case-study-of-where-are-the-joneses/).)
