OSP's Libertinage font is now available [here](http://openfontlibrary.org/media/files/OSP/322).  
  
Libertinage was commissioned for the FLOSS+Art book. It's licenced under the OFL, which is emerging as the standard licence for fonts.  
  
OSP say -  
  


<blockquote>_Libertinage is a remix of Linux Libertine and was designed in August 2008._  
_  
For more detailed information: [ospublish.constantvzw.org](http://ospublish.constantvzw.org/)_  
  
_  
We built Libertinage by copying and pasting parts of Linux Libertine  
glyphs. There are 26 variations, one for each latin letter in the  
alphabet._  
_  
Libertinage.ttf is the 'Full' version, containing all modifications._  
  
_  
Single letter versions are named Libertinage-a, Libertinage-b,  
Libertinage-c... depending on the letter that was changed. All 26 are  
gathered in the Libertinage package as .ttf files._
