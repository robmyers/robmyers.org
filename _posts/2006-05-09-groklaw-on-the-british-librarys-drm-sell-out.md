_The British Library - "The world's knowledge" DRM'd and for a price_  
  
This is very bad. Microsoft are - what's the word I'm looking for? - encouraging the British Library to lock our heritage away behind DRM that ignores Fair Dealing and FOI.  
I can't believe the British Library are selling us out like this, and I can't believe that they are doing it so eagerly. Anyone involved in this should be ashamed of themselves.
