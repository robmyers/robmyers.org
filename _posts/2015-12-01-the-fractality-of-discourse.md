title: The Fractality Of Discourse
---

Texts exist in discursive space

They contain other texts as quotations and references, self-similar scaled copies.

Major texts are attractors in this space.

Some are singularities that neither light nor heat can escape.

Others are strange attractors that draw endless asymptotic vacillation.

It's the fractality of discourse.

*(After the 1992 original.)*
