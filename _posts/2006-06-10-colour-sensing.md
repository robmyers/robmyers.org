"The board housing the sensor has two LEDs for illumination and a 5.3mm lens.  
The sensor should be about an inch away from the source of the colors it needs  
to detect. Conveniently, the two LEDs converge into one brightly lit spot when  
the sensor board is approximately one inch from the source."
