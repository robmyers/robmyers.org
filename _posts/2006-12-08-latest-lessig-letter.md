The latest Lessig letter has lots of good stuff in it:  
  
The new CC site design, which is cool.  
  
The new license chooser, shaped like a jigsaw and based on intent, which is extremely cool and hopefully will give people more of an idea what they are and aren't allowing when they choose a license.  
  
The new license icons, which make the modules much clearer.  
  
A nod and a wink about FDL compatibility. As long as this is SFDL compatibility, which would answer all my practical objections, I now think this is a good idea.  
  
And a "secondary rights" idea which isn't ideal but which Lessig is open about discussion of, which frankly is better than a perfect idea that isn't open to debate.  
  
Take a look:
