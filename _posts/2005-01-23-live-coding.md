I first found out about the idea of Live Coding, hacking running code live onstage to generate music and visuals, from an O'Reilley article mentioned on Slashdot.  
  
[The article](http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2004/08/31/livecode.html).  
  
Toplap are the Live Coding masters. They've featured at a number of shows.  
  
[Toplap's web site](http://toplap.org/).  
  
Other groups are springing up, such as Openlab, who seem less hardcore about coding live?  
  
[Openlab's web site ](http://www.pawfal.org/openlab/).  
  
Can you really code live? I don't know. Can you really jam live?
