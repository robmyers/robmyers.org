Of a different key to previous series highpoint "The Girl In The Fireplace", this two-parter took The Doctor and Rose to a planet orbiting a black hole ("The Impossible Planet") and to the prison that something claiming to be the devil has been locked in since before the start of the universe ("The Satan Pit"). This was perfect science fiction TV. The murderous aliens, the possessed humans, the lost civilisations and a climax fought with synapses rather than sidearms, the tragedy of the loss of individuals against the backdrop of a threat to the entire universe.  


  
This was dark and scary stuff for 7pm on BBC1, and more than that it was genuinely thought provoking. And dramatic, one of the kids said they thought The Doctor had died after - what do you mean you didn't watch it? Go and watch it now!
