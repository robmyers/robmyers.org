I updated minara's C code to be closer to the GNU coding standards.  
  
I think I'm going to mothball minara. Unless I can find anyone to help on it, but I'm not even sure I have the time to look.  
  
Good idea, too far from what I want to be doing right now.  
  
**Update:** This week I have been mostly hacking Minara. It's not mothballed, just something I'm working on as-and-when, the same as everything else. Currently I'm working on picking. Next is probably some basic UI work and then transformations.
