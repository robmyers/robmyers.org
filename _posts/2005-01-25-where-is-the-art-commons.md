A year ago I placed all my art under a Creative Commons license. I assumed that other people would follow suit. But they haven't. Where is all the other Creative Commons licensed art?   
Ultimately, I feel like Rauschenberg knocking on DeKooning's door to ask for a drawing to erase. License just one work. You'll lose some part of it, but you'll be contributing to something more. And, unlike DeKooning, you may get more back in return.
