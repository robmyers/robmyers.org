[Artist/roboticist teaching neural-net bots to love and dance to punk music - Boing Boing](http://www.boingboing.net/2008/06/23/artistroboticist-tea.html)  
  


<blockquote>_Artist Fiddian Warman built some robots controlled by a neural network. neural networks can learn, so he's been playing them classic punk records in an attempt to turn them into robotic versions of his younger self. the robots are 2 metres tall and have the ability to pogo. It all culminates in a gig at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London 3-5 July 2008: bring your friends_</blockquote>

  
  
This should be good.  
  
(Disclosure: I was at the Centre For Electronic Arts with Fiddian, I was also briefly in SoDA with him, and he's great.)
