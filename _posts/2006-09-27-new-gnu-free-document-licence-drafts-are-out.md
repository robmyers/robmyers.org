[Guide to the new drafts of documentation licenses ‚Äù GPLv3](http://gplv3.fsf.org/doclic-dd1-guide.html)  
  
_The first discussion draft of the GNU Free Documentation License version 2 was released on 2006 September 26, along with a draft of the new GNU Simpler Free Documentation License._  
  
The SFDL is much better than the FDL, and you can move FDL work with no invariant sections to it. The FSF should use it as the main FDL. And not do a Wiki Licence either. Even CC didn't do a Wiki Licence. ;-)
