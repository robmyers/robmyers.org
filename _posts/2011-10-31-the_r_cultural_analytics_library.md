I have gathered together much of the code from my series of posts on Exploring Art Data as a library for the R programming language which is now available as a package on R-Forge:  
[  
https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/rca/](https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/rca/)  
  
I will be adding more code to the library over time. It's very easy to install, just enter the following into an R session:  
  

**`install.packages("CulturalAnalytics", repos="http://R-Forge.R-project.org")  
  
`**The library includes code for ImagePlot-style image scatter plots, colour histograms and colour clouds and other useful functions. The examples in the documentation should help new users to get started quickly.  
  
R is the lingua franca for statistical computing, and I believe that it's important for art and digital humanities computing to avail itself of its power.
