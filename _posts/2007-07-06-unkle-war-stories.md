UNKLE's "Psyence Fiction" was one of my favourite albums of the 1990s, a genuine step forward in the dialogue between American and British music, bringing trip-hop, rap, indie and dance together and further. The follow-up, "Never Never Land" wasn't very good, with wimpy vocals and lyrics and aimless music.  
  
UNKLE's third album, "War Stories", is very good. Buy it. It's easier for you to listen to samples than me to explain what they're like, so:

The only downside is that the limited edition is packed a bit tight into its slipcase. You'll need about 20 minutes and a spatula to get the CDs out.
