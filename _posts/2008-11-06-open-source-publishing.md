The excellent [Open Source Publishing](http://ospublish.constantvzw.org/), who did the design for the [FLOSS+Art](http://ospublish.constantvzw.org/?p=565) book that my revised "Open Source Art Again" essay appears in have used some quotes from it (or the [older version](http://blog.p2pfoundation.net/rob-myers-critique-of-open-source/2007/08/25) reblogged by [the P2P Foundation](http://blog.p2pfoundation.net/)) as part of a thoughtful and insightful blog post on their name and what "freedom" might mean for design [here](http://ospublish.constantvzw.org/?p=1315). Highly recommended for anyone interested in free culture and/or graphic design.
