A collection of artworks, texts and resources about freedom and openness in the arts, in the age of the Internet. Freedom to collaborate - to use, modify and redistribute ideas, artworks, experiences, media and tools. Openness to the ideas and contributions of others, and new ways of organising and making decisions together.
  
  
This non exhaustive collection is intended to inspire, inform and enable people to apply peer-to-peer principles for making things and getting organised together. We hope that all art lovers, makers, thinkers, organisers and strategists will find something for them from this set of imaginative, communitarian and dynamic contemporary practices.  
  
Curated by Furtherfield: Ruth Catlow and Marc Garrett with additional texts by Charlotte Frost and Rob Myers.

Furtherfield commission 'Balloon Dog' by Rob Myers.  
  
A downloadable freely licensed 3D model of an artwork to print and remix. 2011 Furtherfield commission.  
  
Balloon Dog forms part of a series of shareable DIY 'readymades' for an era of digital copying and sharing. Iconic objects from the history of appropriation and remixing art are recreated as 3D-digital models. Users can then download and send the digital model to 3D printers via the Internet to receive their own physical artwork through the post at a scale of their choosing.
