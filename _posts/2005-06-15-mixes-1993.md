These are mash-ups of pictures by well-known British artists, made in 1993. As with any mash-up they set up a tension between their sources, in this case different subjects of regard. Or desire.  


  
I can't find the original files for these so I had to scan them from the video prints. And I can't remember whether these were done on an Amiga or a 286 PC, I think probably a 286 with a slide scanner, but they were mashed together using morphing software available at the time. The above image was also painted, oil on canvas.
