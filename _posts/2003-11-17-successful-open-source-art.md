Successful open source software projects tackle well-defined tasks  
with a sense of shared purpose, good acceptance criteria and good  
public rewards. Open source art projects need to be the same. Just  
setting up a CVS server or studio and letting people walk in won't get  
anywhere (although such resources will be needed). A show theme, a  
mural/installation/public art call or other focus is what is  
required. And a good firewall to prevent trolls sabotaging the work.  
  
A good example of a small but practical open source _design_  
project is the SVG Flag repository.  
  
[SVG Flag Repository article](http://www.gnomedesktop.org/article.php?sid=1421)   
  
The flags are actually in the public domain. An equivalent artistic  
project might be a library of motifs or graphical elements. Perhaps  
colour schemes, compositions or compositional elements, images to be  
modified or sampled. Set a theme each month and let people vote for  
the best.  
  
Themes for the Linux desktop projects are open source, and are the  
contemporary equivalent of religious art or of still lifes. Religious  
art because they are icons of faith (work). Still lifes  
because they are objects of regard and show absent wealth  
(information). This, rather than the backward "art museums need  
something to fill them" of gallery art is the art of the future, but  
its Sistine Chapel Ceiling is some way off yet.
