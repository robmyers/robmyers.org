[![bluetooth small sensorium](/assets/assets_c/2012/01/small_sensorium_bluetooth-thumb-500x375-76.jpg)](/weblog/2012/01/15/small_sensorium_bluetooth.jpg)  
That's a Bluetooth wireless small sensorium. The code to support this is a bit hacky as rxtx doesn't seem to want to play with Bluetooth serial ports, but it works.  
  
The code is in the repository:

Next I need to wired up the LEDs directly.  
  
Then a WiFi Arduino that could work with Thingspeak directly. And multiple sensoria could interact.
