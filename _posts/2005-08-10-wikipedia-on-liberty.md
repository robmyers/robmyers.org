Liberty is what people often mean by "freedom". The freedom of "Free Culture" and "Free Software" is a matter of liberty, and is essentially liberal freedom, rather than a more radical freedom (such as anarchism).  


  
[Liberty](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty).  
  
"[On Liberty](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Liberty)" by John Stuart Mill (and the[ full text ](http://wikisource.org/wiki/On_Liberty).)  
  
"[Two Concepts of Liberty](http://wikisource.org/wiki/On_Liberty)" by Isaiah Berlin.  


  
If anyone knows of any good writers on the subject more recent than Berlin, let me know. Opinion seems divided online. :-)
