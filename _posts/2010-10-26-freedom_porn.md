Some time ago I mentioned [Sharing is Sexy](/weblog/2008/01/sharing-is-sexy-open-source-porn-laboratory-sex-positive-collective.html), a Free Culture porn project. The site seems to be offline unfortunately (archive.org has a [cache](http://web.archive.org/web/20080319140930/http://www.sharingissexy.org/)). But now there's a new Free Culture Porn site, [FreedomPorn.org](http://www.freedomporn.org/smut/Freedom_Porn) :  
  


<blockquote>_Introducing, [FreedomPorn.org](http://www.freedomporn.org/smut/Freedom_Porn), the world's first ever free-as-in-freedom porn site, comprised of entirely [free cultural works](http://freedomdefined.org/Definition)
in free formats, both Ogg Theora and WebM. Freedom Porn (FP) is a
participatory resource for ethical smut, promoting our favorite ideals,
and running on donations. From the about page:  
  
_
> 
> <blockquote>_The mission of **Freedom Porn** is to
empower and engage individuals to create and share ethical porn as a
means of advancing sex-positivism and sexual freedom._
>> 
>> 

>> 
>> _We advocate safer sex and consensual sex, and feminism is inseparable
from our mission. We also fight for freedom of speech, privacy,
and free culture._
>> 
>> </blockquote>
> 
> </blockquote>


Sounds good. I'm glad that the project has a specifically feminist element and that it's using free video formats. That last sentence shouldn't read as strangely as it does.
