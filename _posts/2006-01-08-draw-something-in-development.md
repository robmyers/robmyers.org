Multiple figures, but they don't relate yet (I'm working on it).  


  
![Drawing-1](/wp-content/drawing-1.jpg)  
  
With skeleton shown for debugging.  
  
![Drawing2-1](/wp-content/drawing2-1.jpg)  
  
With no skeleton.  
  
  
  
This version just uses PostScript's fill operator to handle outline visibility, but I'm working on an algorithm to only draw outlines where they would be visible.
