Run, don't walk, to get a subscription to the new quarterly art/technology/weirdness journal [Hack Circus](http://hackcircus.com/). It's like the Fortean Times as published by Make Magazine, or Mondo 2000 by Strange Attractor Journal. Issue 2 is just out and contains articles on the nature of reality, choreography as code & vice versa, and personality mimicking bots on Twitter amongst other things. I can't recommend it highly enough.
