Legal documents and art:  


  
Mel Ramsden's [Guaranteed Paintings](http://www.lisson.co.uk/aandl/page/d/150.htm).  


  
Angela Bulloch's [Rules Series](http://www.tractor.com/bulloch4.html).  


  
Carey Young's [Disclaimers](http://www.careyyoung.com/past/disclaimerseries.html).  


  
I love all these works, but Young's disclaimers are for me the most artistic because they involve [negative space](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_space). They were exhibited at the Moore centre, their creation of form through negative space makes them appropriately sculptural.  


  
I wanted to do some indemnified paintings, but I think using licenses themselves, as assisted readymades could be more interesting. CC-*, FDL, OGL. It would be good to do the Godel thing of encoding a contradictory message using the license, ironising it. It would be even better to encode a meta-message, also Godel-style.
