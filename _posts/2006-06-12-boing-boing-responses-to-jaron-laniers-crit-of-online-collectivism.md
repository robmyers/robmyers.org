[Boing Boing: Responses to Jaron Lanier's crit of online collectivism  
](http://www.boingboing.net/2006/06/10/responses_to_jaron_l.html)  
_ My response is quite simple: this alleged "core belief" is not one which is held by me, nor as far as I know, by any important or prominent Wikipedians. Nor do we have any particular faith in collectives or collectivism as a mode of writing. Authoring at Wikipedia, as everywhere, is done by individuals exercising the judgment of their own minds._
