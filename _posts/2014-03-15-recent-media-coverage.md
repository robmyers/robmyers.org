[![urinal](/assets/2014/03/urinal-mention-resized.png)](http://hyperallergic.com/102576/the-art-of-3d-printing/)

[Hyperallergic](http://hyperallergic.com/102576/the-art-of-3d-printing/) featured Tom Burtonwood's remixes of [Urinal](/urinal/) in their interview with them. I do need to work out how BY-SA applies here.

[![facecoin](/assets/2014/03/facecoin-mention-resized.png)](http://rhizome.org/editorial/2014/feb/26/prosthetic-knowledge-picks-code-and-economics/)

[Rhizome](http://rhizome.org/editorial/2014/feb/26/prosthetic-knowledge-picks-code-and-economics/) featured [Facecoin](/facecoin/) in an article on digital currencies and art. They also mentioned "[_MON3Y AS AN 3RRROR | MON3Y.US](http://www.furtherfield.org/features/reviews/mon3y-3rrror-mon3yus)" and "[Computers and Capital](http://www.furtherfield.org/features/reviews/computers-and-capital-rise-digital-currency)", which are the last two shows I've reviewed for Furtherfield.

And [the Tate gallery](http://www.tate.org.uk/context-comment/blogs/archives-access-project-open-data-brings-beauty-and-insight) featured [Exploring Tate Art Open Data 2](/2014/02/08/exploring-tate-art-open-data-2/) in a survey of artistic responses to their collection dataset release.
