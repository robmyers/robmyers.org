[Birkhoff](http://www.maa.org/mathland/mathtrek_05_24_04.html):  
  
M = O / C  
  
Where O is the degree of order of the work, C is the degree of complexity, and M is the aesthetic measure.  
  
[Gips & Stiny](http://www.algorithmicaesthetics.org/page103.htm):  
  
Ez<α, β> = L(β) / L(α)  
  
Where <α, β> is an interpretation of a work, L(α) is the length of the input component of the interpretation and L(β) is the length of the output component of the interpretation, and Ez<α, β> is the aesthetic value assigned to the interpretation.
