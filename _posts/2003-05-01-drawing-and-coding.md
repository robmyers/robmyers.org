(Figurative) drawing and programming are both about structuring perceptions in-keeping with representational schemes to enable engaging with subjects. Competent drawing is regarded as technically conservative. Which is ridiculous given that the last fifty years have seen drawing used more than ever before. Animation, computer games, graphic design, movies and web/UI design all use drawing as part of their design process. Programming must also be technically conservative, which means that "technically conservative" is a weak and suspect label.
