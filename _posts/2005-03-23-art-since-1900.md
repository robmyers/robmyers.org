Good review in the [Grauniad](http://www.guardian.co.uk/arts/features/story/0,11710,1443874,00.html) :  
  
_this book is the final ludicrous monument to an intellectual corruption that has filled contemporary museums and the culture they sustain with a hollow and boring, impersonal chatter_  
  
But I think that A&L did better in the 1970s:  
  
_On the Material Necessity that the _**_Editors_**_ of _**_October_**_, its _**_Contributors_**_, Supporters and Relatives, and Particularly, the Arch Fool, the Illiterate Liar Jeremy G. Rolfe, be Sought Out, Their Hands Smashed, Their Eyes Put Out, Their Offices, Ateliers Destroyed, Burned and Portions of the Bloodstained Ashes Sent to the Towering Wretches of French Structuralism_
