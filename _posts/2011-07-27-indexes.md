"Railing" refers to "Never Let Me Down Again" by Depeche Mode, "True Faith" by New Order, "Ash Wednesday" and "Gerontion"by T.S. Eliot, and a large stuffed toy tiger in a living room. Sometimes in the same line.  
  
"Running For The Gates" refers to every time I wasn't shot while at an airport, specifically to being late for a connecting flight for SXSW, and to being too tired to answer the phone.  
  
"Wide Of The Mark" refers to NASA's Genesis probe, Gerontion again and "The Waste Land", "A Design For Life" by the Manic Street Preachers, "Dominion", "This Corrosion" and "Some Kind Of Stranger" by The Sisters Of Mercy, "Like Eating Glass" by Bloc Party, and "Slow Hands" by Interpol.  
  
"Kindness" refers to "Railing", "I Don't Want To Talk About It" by Rod Stewart as performed by Everything But The Girl, and Shakespeare's "Julius Caesar". Almost.  
  
I may even publish the rest of these some day.
