My latest review for Furtherfield is of igloo's excellent "SwanQuake the user manual".  
  
See here: [http://www.furtherfield.org/displayreview.php?review_id=300](http://www.furtherfield.org/displayreview.php?review_id=300)  
  
Igloo are having a [launch party on Friday](http://nodel.org/new_events.php?ID=145), which sadly I can't get to but I would highly recommend if you can make it.
