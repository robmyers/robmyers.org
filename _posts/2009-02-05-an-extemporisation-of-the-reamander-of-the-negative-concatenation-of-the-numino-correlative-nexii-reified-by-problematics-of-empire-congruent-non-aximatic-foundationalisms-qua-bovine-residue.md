[a rant, via netbehaviour]  
  
Art *is* the specialised language [for art].  
  
Being smart at medicine is no good when a car won't start. But being  
good at quoting Theory is good no matter what, apparently, much like the  
transferable skills of management. The idea that Theory is the proper  
domain language of art is one that needs "problematising". Or spanking.  
  
I'd refer to my favourite theorists Art & Language to make two points.  
  
The first is that art is only a defensible activity if it does things  
that cannot be done any other way. Reducing art to a mash-up of  
fashionable cod-philosopho-political jargon doesn't do this, and *art*  
students are within their rights to reject the verbal fetishes of this  
cult in favour of actually making art. And/or theories.  
  
The second is that given the current march of a corporate information  
culture grinding the world down to manageable, sellable binary digits  
(cf Alan Liu), the aesthetic is not the conservative fetish of the  
illiterate - it is a vital means of resistance. One that the semiotic  
managers of Theory are helping to neutralise.
