So culture is a commons, and there is a movement devoted to reclaiming that commons from enclosure and the excesses of law.  


  
In the UK, historically, the Chartists and the Levellers were groups that worked to reclaim the commons. And the allotment movement was an attempt to provide a substitute.  


  
So are "copyfighters" digital Levellers? And are Creative Commons the cultural allotment movement? I hope not. But this comparison may help explain the popularity of the CC NonCommercial license.
