Opsound have joined Loca in the Creative-Commons-licensed CD market, and Positron are kinda sorta gonna start CC-licensing work:  
  
[Loca](http://www.locarecords.com/)   
[Opsound](http://www.opsound.org/opsound/opshop.html)   
[Positron](http://www.positronrecords.com/cc/)   
  
Positron have got a [CC-remix competition here](http://www.positronrecords.com/artists/micro/contest/index.html). This is good because you get the "sources" for the track to play with, which is more what Free Music should be about.
