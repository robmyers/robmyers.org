There's a play on in Baltimore this week by Trish Harnetiaux called "If You Can Get To Buffalo" about Julian Dibbell's 1990s Village Voice LambdaMOO article, "A Rape in Cyberspace":

There's an interview with the playwright here:

This isn't the first dramatic presentation of LambdaMOO, another example is this short film scripted from chat logs:

Dibbell's article was expanded into a book. It is a sometimes salacious but ultimately insightful examination of life on the MOO. You can read it here:

A more comprehensive insight into the operation, history and geography of LambaMOO is "Yib's Guide To MOOing", available here:

And a more ethnographic study of MOOing with lots of interesting historical and cultural details is Lynne Cherny's "Conversation and Community: Chat in a Virtual World", which you'll have to buy a copy of:

LambdaMOO is still here and is well worth exploring. You can install a Telnet client on your computer or mobile device (there's one already on MacOS X) and telnet to:
