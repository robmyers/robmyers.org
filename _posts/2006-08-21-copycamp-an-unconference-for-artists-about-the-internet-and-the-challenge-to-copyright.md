[CopyCamp | An unconference for artists about the Internet and the challenge to copyright](http://copycamp.ca/)  
  
_CopyCamp is a place to meet people making art and making waves, an opportunity to discover how the Internet can work for artists and fans, and a chance to debate the value(s) of copyright with some of the key players. It is an event in which participants drive the programming, and debates are genuine round-tables. There are no observers: everyone has something to offer and is expected to contribute._
