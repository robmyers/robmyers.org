[Look, See: May 06, 2007 - May 12, 2007 Archives](http://www.chrisashley.net/weblog/archives/week_2007_05_06.html#001931)  
  
A little while ago I wrote a review of Chris Ashley's weblog "Look, See" for Furtherfield.  
  
Chris has continued making engaging art in HTML at a phenomenal rate . His current images with their drop shadows and eight-bit-looking palettes are wonderful.  
  
Do take a look.
