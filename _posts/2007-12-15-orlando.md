"Different sexps, same project."  
  
Orlando is the codename for a port of Minara to Common Lisp. Minara was originally written in Scheme with some C code for rendering. A port to Common Lisp has the following benefits:  
  


  

  * Better development and debugging support.
  *   

  * A richer programming language with more expressive potential.
  

  * Stronger object system.
  *   

  * A language that I (the developer) am more familiar with.
  

  * Library support for OpenGL.
  

  * Hopefully a speed increase, or at least no appreciable speed loss.
  
  
  
The target Common Lisp is SBCL, which runs on all major platforms. There will be very little implementation-specific code included and this will be carefully factored out.  
  
I'm currently aiming for an April 2008 pre-alpha release.
