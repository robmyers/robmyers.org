**Babylon, 1772BC, about tea time.
**King Hammurabi is explaining the idea of laws to several learned persons.

**Hammurabi:** So these laws will regulate how we go about our business in society, backed by the coercive power of the state.

**Learned Person 1:** Hang on. These laws seem to create a causal and moral domain of their own distinct from mere human intercourse. What if they go wrong?

**Learned Person 2:** Yes, yes! And what if they act against society? Or are written to be evil.

**Hammurabi:** I'm your king. I would never write bad laws.

**Learned Person 1:** Yes but suppose a bad king took over. What then? We need something to protect society from these "laws" if they go wrong.

**Learned Person 3:** Indeed. Most indeededly so.

**Hammurabi:** Well alright. I'll add some laws governing the creation and application of laws. That way, laws can be used to govern laws.

**Learned Person 3:** But that would be like asking the wolf to account for his consumption of lambs!

**Learned Person 1:** Yes I really don't see how using laws to alleviate the potential harm of laws works. That's just circular logic.

**Learned Person 4:** Yes. What next? Perpetual motion? You're just begging the question.

**Hammurabi:** I'm your ****ing king! Shut up and agree with me!

**Learned Person 3:** If we shut up how are we to agree with you? What do your "laws" say about that?

**Learned Person 2:** Yeah. There should be laws against people like you...

**Hammurabi:** GUARDS!
