R is a free software statistical programming language. It has an unusual syntax, similar to Perl in a hight wind, and lots of powerful mathematical tools and abstractions included or available in libraries. You use R to wrangle large lists of numbers in a way that will hopefully produce shorter and more manageable lists of numbers. I'm interested in R for quantitative aesthetics, but there aren't any articles on that so here are some other interesting ones on related topics.
