I'm busy working on Minara and other projects at the moment but I will be getting to London this weekend and next to get to two Free Culture events:  
  
[Free Culture UK Congress](http://www.freeculture.org.uk/wiki/MeetingMinutes/2005-Congress)  
  
[Open Congress](http://opencongress.omweb.org/modules/wakka/HomePage)
