An artist should only receive public money when the value of the art that they make using that money is made available to the public.It should be a condition of receiving Arts Council funding that any work produced is made available to the public under a Creative Commons Attribution or Share-Alike licence (not Non-Commercial or No-Derivatives licenses as these deny value to the public).This ensures that the public are able to benefit from the work they have paid for by copying from it while the artist is still free to sell the original work.
