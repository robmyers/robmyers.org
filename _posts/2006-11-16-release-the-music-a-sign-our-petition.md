[Release The Music Â» Sign our petition](http://www.releasethemusic.org/five-minutes/sign-our-petition/)_ We believe that any extension to the term of copyright protection for sound recordings would be highly damaging to artists and the public good. We hereby request that you publicly reject all demands from all parties for any extension, retrospective or prospective, to the term of copyright protection for sound recordings._Readers in the UK, please sign this petition from ORG and also take a look at the Release The Music web site:[http://www.releasethemusic.org/](http://www.releasethemusic.org/)
