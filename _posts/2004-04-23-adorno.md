I've started trying to read "Aesthetic Theory". I suspect it's a bad translation, because the introduction is as unreadable as the main text, possibly even less so. Like recent Virilio translations...  
There's a critique of the book on Amazon.com that mistakenly believes Adorno's musical biases to be "the intellectual equivalent of white flight", whereas in fact I imagine that they're just anti-American, as he left the place to return to Germany before writing "Aesthetic Theory"...
