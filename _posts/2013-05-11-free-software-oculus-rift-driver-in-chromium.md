With a [nightly build of Chromium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium_(web_browser)#Nightly_Binaries) and experimental code from [vr.js](https://github.com/benvanik/vr.js) you can run a free software JavaScript/WebGL Oculus Rift environment on GNU//Linux:

The demo allows you to look around the inside of a cube, which reads as a room. It's fun, and an exciting step for the Rift and Free Software.
