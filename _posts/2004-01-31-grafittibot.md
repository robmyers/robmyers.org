I love this grafitti-drawing spraycan robot:  
[Hektor](http://www.hektor.ch/)  
It's like a grunge version of AARON.  
Art & Language's idea that painting could be justified if its products couldn't be created any other way applies to drawing machines as well. There are scales and complexities a human being couldn't draw at speed (Nobson Newtown being a case in point) but that might be relevent to a contemporary realism. A drawing machine could achieve this and allow a more iterative creative process rather than a painstaking postconceptual rendering ritual.
