My copy of "[No Business](http://www.negativland.com/nobiz/index.html)" arrived.  


  
You get a copyright whoopie cushion. :-) Oh, and a CD and a booklet in a folder. The CD is way-above-average appropriation/cut-up/mix-up music. The booklet is a cool essay on creativity and the public domain. There's a video on the CD as well. It's all under the CC-Sampling license. Which is slightly incongruous, the same as it was for People Like Us. Did I mention the whoopie cushion?  


  
Cool.
