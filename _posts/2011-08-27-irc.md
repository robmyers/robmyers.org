irc is an old text-based internet chat system that still gets used by many projects.  
  
irssi is a good client for irc. You can find out how to set it up, including how to configure it to automatically connect to servers and channels [here](http://tech-newbie.blogspot.com/2008/04/how-to-install-and-use-irssi-linux-irc.html) .  
  
It's best to run irssi in a GNU screen session on a remote server and then connect to that when you want to chat. This allows you to keep track of conversations in channels even when you are not online. Here's a script to do this. Save it as irc somewhere on your PATH (e.g. in the bin directory in your HOME), chmod +x it, and then it's easy.  
  


    
    #!/bin/bash
    SSH_HOST=your.host.name.possibly.of.the.form.username@your.host.name
    IRSSI_SESSION=irc
    ssh -t ${SSH_HOST} "screen -dr ${IRSSI_SESSION} || \
    screen -S ${IRSSI_SESSION} irssi"
