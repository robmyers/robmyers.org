The album "Floodland" by The Sisters Of Mercy was released on the 17th of November 1987.  
  
It's an absolute classic and one of the two major initial drivers of my worldview (the other being Michael Moorcock's Jerry Cornelius stories).  
  
If you don't own a copy, buy one. If you do, the re-release has extra tracks on. ;-)
