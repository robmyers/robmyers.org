[“Zero influence!” Â» Blog Archive Â» Still River](http://zeroinfluence.wordpress.com/2006/07/07/still-river/)_Still River is the working title to a new project that I've initated with the art critic, JJ Charlesworth and artist Rob Myers.__We'll be working up the details over the next few weeks, but the framework seems to be about the institutionalisation and distribution of â€˜ideas'. The project in itself aims to to be an inquiry into the relationship of code and language, how ideas transfer from object to object and where the network relationships are._This is the first time I've been press-ganged into a project on the basis of being an artist rather than on the basis of being a coder. :-) I'm hoping we can do a free cultural criticism, a kind of Art & Language for the p2p era.
