<blockquote>_Tens of thousands of Buddhist manuscripts, paintings and other treasures scattered around the world have been brought together in probably the world's largest computer database of its kind._  
  
_The International Dunhuang Project (IDP), based at the British Library in London, is an ever-growing digital assemblage that makes it possible to study online around 160,000 images of 80,000 objects dug up in the deserts of Chinese central Asia and now in institutions across Europe, Asia and North America._
