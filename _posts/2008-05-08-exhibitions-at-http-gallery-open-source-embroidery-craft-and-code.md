[Exhibitions at HTTP Gallery. Open Source Embroidery: Craft and Code](http://www.http.uk.net/exhibitions/OSE/index.shtml)  
  
_This exhibition explores the connections between the collaborative characteristics of needlework, craft and Open Source software. This project has brought together embroiderers, patch-workers, knitters, artists and computer programmers, to share their practice and make new work. _  
  
I met the curator/artist at an HTTP social last year and they are a very thoughtful and insightful commentator on "Open Source". The show should be good, and if you can get to the opening I recommend it.
