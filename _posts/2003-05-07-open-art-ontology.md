For several projects I need a semantic net/slipnet to represent aesthetic concepts for a program to work with. This could be generally useful (or at least amusing) so it could be an open source project.  
Prolog, like Lisp/Scheme, is another language that doubles as a data structuring file format and it is ideal for representing semantic nets and frames, and you can implement it in about five lines of itself. ;-) So this will be in Prolog.
