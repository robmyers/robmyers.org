Sometimes, in a free society, we may read things that we not only don't agree with but that we find personally offensive. For me, Charlie Gere's "Non-Relational Aesthetics" is that book. It is the most godawful piece of shit ostensiby about art that it has ever been my misfortune to read. But rather then firebombing the publisher, as Gere defended other aggrieved critics doing recently, I'll commend Artwords Press for seeking out new voices and encouraging readers to engage with ideas that they might not otherwise encounter.
