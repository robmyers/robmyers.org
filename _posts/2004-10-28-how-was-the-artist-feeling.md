One project I want to do is a system to map random emotional states (encoded using one of the systems discussed in "Affective Computing") through a slipnet onto to visual expressive qualities that a drawing module could use to constrain an image. An Emotron. That would answer a recurring criticism of computer art; that it's cold and unemotional. :-)
