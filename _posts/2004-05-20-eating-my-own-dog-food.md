"1968" needs finishing. It's colour that's the problem. I want a more fluid and accurate way of working with colour than the current crop of illustration software gives me.  
Minara needs continuing. it needs real tasks and projects to work on.  
So I'm going to write the bits of Minara I need to edit "1968". Defining colours, managing colour accuracy, and possibly hit-testing will all be needed. I'll also have to make sure the import filter works well to convert 1968 to minara format.  
In software engineering jargon this is known as "eating your own dog food". Yum.
