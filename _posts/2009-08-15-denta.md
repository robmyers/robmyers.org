I adapted the source code for Twitta to make Denta, a Free Software client for identi.ca on Android.  
  
[Application package](/weblog/2009/08/15/Denta.apk)  
  
[Source code](/weblog/2009/08/15/denta_0.1.tar.gz)  
  
I've changed the package name, the readme and the icons from their Twitta versions to differentiate Denta for the OS and users. But to be clear, this is just a search-and-replace hack of Twitta.  
  
Any bug reports or questions should be sent via the comments for this post. Thanks.
