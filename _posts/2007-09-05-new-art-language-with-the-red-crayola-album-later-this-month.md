Art & Language and The Red Krayola (nee Crayola) have a new album out this month, around the 25th depending on where you are in the world.  
  
Previews indicate that the sound is a very contemporary 1960s retro and as unlistenably brilliant as ever. The Art & Language work the title and cover draw on is a decade old, so I don't know how long this has been in the works. But I am absolutely stoked that this is coming out now  
  
More details from Drag City[ here](http://www.dragcity.com/news.html) (scroll down to September).  
  
Order from [Amazon US](http://www.amazon.com/Sighs-Trapped-Liars-Red-Krayola/dp/B000U6OWTE/ref=sr_1_1/026-2381971-7053211?ie=UTF8&s=music&qid=1188941648&sr=8-1) or [Amazon UK](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Sighs-Trapped-Liars-Red-Krayola/dp/B000U6OWTE/ref=sr_1_1/026-2381971-7053211?ie=UTF8&s=music&qid=1188941648&sr=8-1) if you must. But it would be better to order it through your local record shop.
