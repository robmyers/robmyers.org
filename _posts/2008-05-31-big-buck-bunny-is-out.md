And it's brilliant. Seriously, these guys know more about classic humorously violent funny animal cartoons than Dreamworks animators have ever been told they can't use by their managerial overlords.  
  
See here for downloads: [Big Buck Bunny Downloads](http://www.bigbuckbunny.org/index.php/download/)  
  
And buy the 2 DVD set for PAL & NTSC versions of the cartoon as well as all the "source" used to make it, the 3D models, textures, animations, etc: [Big Buck Bunny DVD](http://www.blender3d.org/e-shop/product_info.php?products_id=97)  
  
But will the soundtrack be released under a Free licence this time?
