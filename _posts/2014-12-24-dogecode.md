Hello World!**`


Cryptographic asset tokens can represent [all kinds of things](http://fr.reddit.com/r/xdp/list_of_possible_ways_to_use_tokens/).

Including computer programs. Introducing...:


**[Dogecode](https://gitorious.org/robmyers/dogecode/)**


(There are several other projects called Dogecode. This isn't them).

Dogecode takes computer programs in the [Brainfuck](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) programming language (chosen for simplicity of encoding):

    ++++++++[>++++[>++>+++>+++>+<<<<-]>+>+>->>+[<]<-]>>.>---.+++++++..+++.>>.<-.<.+++.------.--------.>>+.>++.


and translates them into a csv file of token amounts using dcc:


    INCB,8
    JFOR,1
    INCP,1
    INCB,4
    JFOR,1
    INCP,1
    INCB,2
    INCP,1
    INCB,3
    INCP,1
    ...


which are then sent to a [Dogeparty](http://www.dogeparty.io/) address (slowly) as a series of token transfer transactions using dcsend:


    Sending lots of tokens. Make sure you really want to do this.
    Waiting for token state to synch
    Row 1: INCB,8
    Waiting for token state to synch...........
    Row 2: JFOR,1
    Waiting for token state to synch.............
    Row 3: INCP,1
    Waiting for token state to synch........
    Row 4: INCB,4
    Waiting for token state to synch..................
    Row 5: JFOR,1
    Waiting for token state to synch.......................
    Row 6: INCP,1
    Waiting for token state to synch.......................
    Row 7: INCB,2
    Waiting for token state to synch......
    Row 8: INCP,1
    Waiting for token state to synch......
    Row 9: INCB,3
    Waiting for token state to synch......
    Row 10: INCP,1
    Waiting for token state to synch.....................
    Row 11: INCB,3
    Waiting for token state to synch..............
    Row 12: INCP,1
    Waiting for token state to synch.....


The transactions encode the program on the [address](http://dogepartychain.info/address/DCvDS9g9VUZ94MSLbWi4zWRtxHrXeEctZ3), which can then be fetched and run as seen at the top of this post using dcrun.

For more details see the [whitepaper](https://gitorious.org/robmyers/dogecode/source/doc).

**Update:** There's an easier to use runner and more examples [here](/2014/12/29/easier-dogecode/).
