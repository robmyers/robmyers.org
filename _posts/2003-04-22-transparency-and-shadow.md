"The quintessentially modernist ideal of a transparent, shadowless work" - 'States of Secrecy', Michael Gauthier in ''Too Dark To Read.  
  
"...the replacement of 'visual art' by texts was being celebrated as the driving out of allusion and shadow by transparency - a direct channel thereby being opened to the 'meanings' and 'intentions' of the artist" - 'Almost Too dark To See', Charles Harrison ibid.
