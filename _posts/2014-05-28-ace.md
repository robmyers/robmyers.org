[![ace](/assets/2014/05/ace.png)](/assets/2014/05/ace.png)
ace is a command-line development environment for Ethereum contracts.

It's designed to simplify writing and testing contracts. The initial (alpha!) version supports Serpent contracts and local testing using pyethereum.

You can get it here:

For an Emacs mode for editing Serpent code, see here:

Bug reports gratefully received.
