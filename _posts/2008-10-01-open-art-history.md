Open Art History is a proposed project to gather and distribute  
reproductions of artworks and art historical documents. Art is a form of  
knowledge, and art history is a way of presenting that knowledge. Access  
to high quality reproductions of images of art and to literature & data  
concerning art history is of great value to artists, critics, art  
historians, art theorists and educators.

The initial aim of the project is to identify standards for data and image formats for projects.  
  
The pilot project for Open Art History will be Open Hogarth. This is due  
to the availability and comparative ease of reproduction of Hogarth's  
work, its social and historical relevance, its art historical  
importance, and its popularity with the general public. Hogarth's  
literary nature is also a link to the Open Literature project, and his  
place in the history of the copyright of art makes him an interesting  
subject for a Free Knowledge project.

The initial aim of the project is to find sources for high-quality  
digital photographs or scans of Hogarth etchings online.
