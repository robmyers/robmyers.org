Richter's blurry photo paintings as critique.   
JPEGs are a 'green' format, conserving limited resources (in bad conscience). They prioritise distribution over fidelity. Their participant's gaze ignores loss. reconstituting it from expectation, glad to receive an approximation in less time.   
  
'JPEG is designed for compressing either full-color or gray-scale images  
of natural, real-world scenes. It works well on photographs, naturalistic  
artwork, and similar material; not so well on lettering, simple cartoons,  
or line drawings. JPEG handles only still images, but there is a related  
standard called MPEG for motion pictures.  
JPEG is "lossy," meaning that the decompressed image isn't quite the same as  
the one you started with. (There are lossless image compression algorithms,  
but JPEG achieves much greater compression than is possible with lossless  
methods.) JPEG is designed to exploit known limitations of the human eye,  
notably the fact that small color changes are perceived less accurately than  
small changes in brightness. Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images  
that will be looked at by humans. If you plan to machine-analyze your  
images, the small errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even  
if they are invisible to the eye.' - _http://www.faqs.org/faqs/jpeg-faq/part1/_
