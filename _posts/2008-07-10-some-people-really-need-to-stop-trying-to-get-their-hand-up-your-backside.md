Dealing with a last-chance careerist nonentity and their agenda generates neither light nor heat. There's a shuffling embarrassment and gazing into your glass that results from being faced with a cretin riding out. When said lackwit also persistently misrepresents what you are saying (or is too incompetent to stump for a clue), giving them the oxygen of google juice is an own goal.  
  
I like blog art and group blogs. I would go to bat for them. I don't like semiowankery or art-historical overbidding or chin-stroking, ladder-climbing, self-regarding idiots who don't know the genealogy of Claris Works. Of the two principles, the latter is the stronger.  
  
British libel law, eh? What can you do.
