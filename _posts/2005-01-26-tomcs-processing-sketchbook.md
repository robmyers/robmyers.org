I love the fact that Processing provides source code for work by default. [Dataisnature](http://www.dataisnature.com/) mentioned this a while ago but it's good enough to take another look:  
  
[TomC's Processing Sketchbook](http://www.tom-carden.co.uk/p5/).  
  
I've finally bitten the Processing bullet and I'm working on a version of my old pieces Ghosts/Subjects with a view to taking them further.
