I like this for two reasons. Firstly I've a soft spot for landscape, and I always like to see someone who takes the idea of a contemporary landscape seriously. Secondly, it's simple but effective use of graphics (and code) rather than algorithmic one-upmanship. The result is something that is situated within and extends the story of_ art_.
