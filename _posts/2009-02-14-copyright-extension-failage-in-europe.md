[http://www.openrightsgroup.org/newsblog/2009/02/eu-committee-approves-copyright-extension/](http://www.openrightsgroup.org/newsblog/2009/02/eu-committee-approves-copyright-extension/)  
  
The European Union have decided, against all the evidence, that copyright on audio (music) recordings should be extended from 50 to 95 years.  
  
Worse, next year they will consider extending audiovisual (film) copyrights to the same ridiculously long term.  
  
The value of most works is exhausted within two years. Setting copyright at almost fifty times that duration, almost double the amount required by the Berne convention on copyright, is not reasonable. This will have a chilling effect on culture and knowledge in return for almost zero economic benefit.
