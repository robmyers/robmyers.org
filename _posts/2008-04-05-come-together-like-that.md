I'm working on "like that" again. The first piece I finished is this one, called "come together". You can see the applet page and source code [here](/art/like_that/come_together/index.html).  
  
"like that" is being written in Processing, which is written in Java, which is being made Free. As with all my art this will be released under a copyleft licence (GPL 3) in an archive containing all work done for the project including any discarded along the way.
