The latest Debian updates to sid have fucked up my iBook. I can have it boot and not use the network, or not boot and presumably use the network. Which is a bit Schrodinger.  
  
This has driven home how good Debian was precisely up to this moment. ;-)  
  
**Update:** It tries to make the ramdisk but the boot process can't find the ramdisk?  
  
E: linux-image-2.6.18-1-powerpc: subprocess post-installation script returned error exit status 2  
E: linux-image-2.6-powerpc: dependency problems - leaving unconfigured  
  
Post parameter wrong in script?  
  
Anyone? :-)
