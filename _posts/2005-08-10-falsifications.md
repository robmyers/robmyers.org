Many of my works are falsifications with surplus value. I mean "falsification" in the scientific sense, showing a theory to be false. A negative proof, a disproof. I mean surplus value in a straight-faced sense: the falsification is not all there is to the work. This is most notable with [Psychetecture](/art/psychetecture), [Surgical Strike](/art/surgical_strike), and [paintr](http://paintr.robmyers.org/). All are a kind of parody of a particular ideology that are nonetheless entirely serious and very effective in themselves.  


  
I've said that with much of my best work I can't tell whether I'm joking or not. I think this is one of the reasons why.
