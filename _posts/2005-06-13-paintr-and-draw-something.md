paintr is draw-something's evil twin. It's the post-dot-com approach as opposed to draw-something's pre-ai-winter approach.  


  
It would be interesting to transcend the two approaches, but it's easier for now to combine them, getting draw-something to draw the shapes and manage the colours. Whether that would be interesting enough I don't know. Maybe I could prototype something quickly.
