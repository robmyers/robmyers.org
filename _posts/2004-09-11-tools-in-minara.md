Here's a screenshot of the first shape I drew in Minara using the buffer, rendering and tool APIs. It's the blob, not the logotype which is loaded from file. It's just a quick test, I couldn't actually see what I was drawing. :-)  
Further testing shows that the buffer code needs replacing, which will add time to the project. But it's encouraging to see this drawing program actually drawing.
