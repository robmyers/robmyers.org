[Art Data Money](http://www.furtherfield.org/artdatamoney/) is [Furtherfield](http://www.furtherfield.org/)'s new programme of art shows, lab events and debates.

> "Art Data Money aims to build a commons for arts in the network age, and invites people to join us and discover new ways for cryptocurrencies and big data to benefit us all."

I've art and writing in the programme, which brings together some of the themes I've been working on for the last few years. Take a look, download a manifesto, join the conversation and buy some re-de-enclosed 3D printed readymade art for Bitcoin.
