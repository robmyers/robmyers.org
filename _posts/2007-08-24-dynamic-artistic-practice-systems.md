To produce "dynamic artistic practice" [AARON](http://www.kurzweilcyberart.com/aaron/history.html) would have to create AARONs. It would have to do what [Harold Cohen](http://www.kurzweilcyberart.com/aaron/hi_cohenbio.html) does; set immediate and long term goals, create systems, evaluate results, reflect on its achievements and work this meta-knowledge into its goals and systems.  
  
This sounds like the sort of goalpost-moving that has always plagued AI. If a computer can play chess then chess playing must not be a sign of intelligenceâ€¦ But "dynamic artistic practice" would be relatively simple to achieve given a system of axiomatic graphical microdomains and a Lisp-style function composition system.  
  
The microdomain approach is the one that [Douglas Hofstadter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Hofstadter) and [FARG](http://www.cogsci.indiana.edu/) took: find a simple task that is representative of an aspect of creative behaviour and then analyze it in depth.  
  
AARON, like any painter, just pushes pigments around in 2D. It's a historically sufficient aesthetic domain in which to create and evaluate constraints or axioms.  
  
It may even generate historically novel techical practice, [Margaret Boden](http://www.sussex.ac.uk/informatics/profile276.html)'s "h-creativity" from [The Creative Mind](http://www.routledge.com/shopping_cart/products/product_detail.asp?sku=&isbn=9780415314534). But this wouldn't be necessary to satisfy the requirements of "dynamic artistic production", as Damien Hirst's appropriations show.  
  
So I'm not making a ridiculous demand of an AARON-like system. This behaviour could be shown by a fairly simple system (like [Copycat](http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~mm/how-to-get-copycat.html)), although to be aesthetically as well as conceptually satisfying it would need to be more complex.
