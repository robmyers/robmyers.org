If you want a USB memory key for something other than windows, don't buy a Discgo Classic. They have some crapware called U3 on that will get in your way and deny several megs of the disk's space to you on Linux and Mac at the hardware level.There's an uninstaller, but it only works on Windows. Despite the packaging claiming Mac and Linux compatibility.Who at Discgo was stupid enough to think that this adds value?
