[Eyebeam reBlog: Center for Tactical Magic](http://www.eyebeam.org/reblog/archives/2006/07/center_for_tactical_magic.html)  
  
_The          Center for Tactical Magic engages in extensive research, development,          and deployment of the pragmatic system known as Tactical Magic. A fusion          force summoned from the ways of the artist, the magician, the ninja, and          the private investigator, Tactical Magic is an amalgam of disparate arts          invoked for the purpose of actively addressing Power on individual, communal,          and transnational fronts. At the CTM we are committed to achieving the          Great Work of Tactical Magic through community-based projects, daily interdiction,          and the activation of latent energies toward positive social transformation._
