The always excellent NewsGrist (required reading for art & free culture) is covering the story, and Joy Garnett makes an interesting comment below her post here -

And in the interest of balance, here's a circular and question-begging apology for enclosure of the public domain and corporatisation of public institutions from the NPG -

<blockquote>_"The Gallery is very concerned that potential loss of
licensing income from the high-resolution files threatens threatens its
ability to reinvest in its digitisation programme and so make further
images available.
_
> 
> _
"It is one of the Gallery's primary purposes to make as much of the Collection available as possible for the public to view."_  
</blockquote>
