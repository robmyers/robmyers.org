I got a wireless card for my iBook. It's easy enough to fit, but routing the net connection through the machine that is connected to the net took some fiddling with the firewall, and too many passwords. This isn't the card's fault, it's MacOSX's connection sharing software, but the combination could be easier to set up.  
  
I'm posting this now using the connection, so it can be made to work. But it's not the simple user experience I expect from Apple.
