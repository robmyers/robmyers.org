The latest FSF newsletter is now online:  
  
[http://www.fsf.org/bulletin/2007/fall/](http://www.fsf.org/bulletin/2007/fall/)  
  
There's an interview with me at the back in which I discuss free art, free culture, collaborative authorship, how lovely the GPL 3 is and why it makes perfect sense that Free Software licences should tackle Tivoisation.  
  
Before you get to that there are also articles by Ben Mako Hill, Brett Smith, Peter Brown and Ben Klemens, and a cartoon.  
  
If you join the FSF you can get a print copy as well, among other benefits. [Join here](https://www.fsf.org/associate/support_freedom?) and tell them I sent you.
