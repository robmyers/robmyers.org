Extracting affect (or sentiment) from electronic text is a hard problem, and it's difficult to persuade people just how hard it is. [The Manhattan Times has an article](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/24/technology/internet/24emotion.html) that explains just how difficult it is, and has lots of useful links to projects and resources. The stand-out link is to Lillian Lee's paper "[Opinion mining and sentiment analysis](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/llee/opinion-mining-sentiment-analysis-survey.html)".   
  
The first project I became aware of that tackled emotion online was [We Feel Fine](http://www.wefeelfine.org/), which uses blogs as its source. More recent systems tend to use Twitter, such as [http://twittermood.org/](http://twittermood.org/) which has useful links to the essays "[Measuring the Happiness of Large-Scale Written Expression](http://www.springerlink.com/content/757723154j4w726k/)" and "[Detecting Sadness in 140 Characters](http://www.webecologyproject.org/2009/08/detecting-sadness-in-140-characters/)" in its references.  
  
And it's an older book now but Rosalind Picard's "[Affective Computing](http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&tid=4060)" is still a useful resource, particularly for its study of emotional taxonomies.
