Inspired by the scripts to find weasel words, passive voice and lexical illusions from -  
  
[http://matt.might.net/articles/shell-scripts-for-passive-voice-weasel-words-duplicates/](http://matt.might.net/articles/shell-scripts-for-passive-voice-weasel-words-duplicates/)  
  
I've written a script to check for artbollocks in essays or reviews.  
  
[/git/?p=scripts.git;a=blob_plain;f=artbollocks](/git/?p=scripts.git;a=blob_plain;f=artbollocks)  
  
To use it, download it and add it to your PATH. Then use it like -  
  
artbollocks my-essay.txt  
  
Can anyone think of any words I've missed that should be added to it?
