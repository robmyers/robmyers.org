Furtherfield have created a beautifully designed pamphlet of a whitepaper that I wrote for them about combining cryptoculture with participatory art shows.

> DAOWO - DAO it With Others
>
> DIWO (Do It With Others) is a distributed campaign for emancipatory, networked art practices instigated by Furtherfield in 2006.
>
> A DAO is a Decentralised Autonomous Organization, effectively a corporation or a charitable trust implemented in networked computer code.
>
> Both are decentralised. A DAO has no single point of failure on the network, existing on the blockchain. A DIWO event is organised online and open to participants worldwide.
>
> Both are an application of network technology to social organization. A DAO implements a corporation, charity, club or co­operative. A DIWO event organizes artists, curators and writers to produce and exhibit work together.
>
> Both are rule driven and participatory. A DAO consists of trustless, incorruptible code that serves the interests of its members or clients. A DIWO event is a themed open call for artworks.
>
> Both are ways of managing scarce resources. A DAO manages resources such as a cryptocurrency token or the lock on a door. A DIWO event allocates the productive efforts and attention of an audience and the display space of a gallery.
>
> A DAOWO would be a combination of the two ­ Decentralised Autonomous Organization With Others.
