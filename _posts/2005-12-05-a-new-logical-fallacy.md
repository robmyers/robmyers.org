A new logical fallacy has been doing the rounds:  


  
**Appeal to Stallman**  


  
_The author appeals to the writings of Free Software guru Richard Stallman in order to make the opposite point to the one Stallman makes. Having removed the possibility of dissent the author is then free to claim that NonCommercial licenses or relicensing work under a less free license are what Stallman would want._
