Generative art, making external processes make your art, is a form of depersonalisation. Yet getting the art you want is "repersonalisation". It's a form of irony, I suppose, if I can add that leaden weight to the idea without it heading straight to the bottom.  
  
Another of my research interests, shapeshifter mythology, is also about depersonalisation and, in its modern form, repersonalisation as well. I think I'm trying to tell myself something, or possibly I'm just overintellectualising things.  
  
Good consumers don't repersonalise, but the cultural creolisation that "kitsch" theory insultingly doesn't capture does. The street finds its own use for things, as William Gibson said.
