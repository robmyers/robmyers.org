_Rhizome is now in the midst of the sixth year of our Commissions Program -- a singular initiative that supports the creation of original works of new media art work. This year, we will award seven artists/ collectives with commissions ranging from $3000-$5000.  
  
Deadline for applications: midnight, March 31, 2008  
  
We support: New Media Art, by which we mean projects that creatively engage new and networked technologies and also works that reflect on the impact of these tools and media in a variety of forms. Commissioned projects can take the final form of online works, performance, video, installation or sound art. Projects can be made for the context of the gallery, the public, or the web.  
  
Amount: 7 commissions in the amount of $3000-5000
