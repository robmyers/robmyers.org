**Volunteerism**  


  
A licence that tries to support non-creative interests by adopting them as part of its terms is volunteerist. Anti-military and human-rights licences are volunteerist. This is a form of instrumentalism.  


  
**WMIMWYIM**  


  
"What's mine is mine what's yours is mine". Licenses or contracts that privilege upstream users or project hosts over downstream users and contributors, usually financially but sometimes attributionally.  


  
**Exploitation**  


  
A project or license that tries to keep or accrue value for a privileged party is exploitative. Or iniquitous. Good examples of this are WMIMWYIM contracts on media hosting sites and the use of noncommercial licensing. This is a form of instrumentalism.  


  
Given the feedback I have received I'd like to be able to replace Instrumentalism with Volunteerism and Exploitation, but I don't think they quite divide the concept between them.  


  
Further feedback gratefully received.
