My 3D printing art project "[Balloon Dog](http://www.furtherfield.org/projects/balloon-dog-rob-myers)" is now available as part of [Collaboration and Freedom - The World of Free and Open Source Art](http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/about-us/digital-innovation-development/thinking-digital/collaboration-and-freedom/). [Furtherfield](http://www.furtherfield.org/projects/balloon-dog-rob-myers) commissioned it as a sequel to [Urinal](/art/urinal/).  
  
![balloon_dog2.png](/assets/balloon_dog2.png)The model was created by Bassam Kurdali, and it's available under a Creative Commons Attrubution-ShareAlike 3.0 unported licence (as with Urinal's modeller Chris Webber, Bassam holds the copyright on the model).   


  
I submitted it to [Boing Boing](http://boingboing.net/2011/09/21/uk-free-and-open-source-art-exhibit.html) and [Thingiverse](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:11830), where there have been some interesting comments, and is already being used for purposes other than 3D printing, which is great to see.
