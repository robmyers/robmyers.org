You can connect to [LambdaMOO](http://lambda.moo.mud.org/) from smart phones and tablets as easily as from desktop computers, if not more so. Then you can access the classic text-based virtual reality anywhere you have a wireless or cell network signal.

or, once you have a character:

## Blackberry
