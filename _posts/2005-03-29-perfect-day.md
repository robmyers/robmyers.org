I slept in until midday, then went for a ride out through Peterborough on my bike. Heading back into town I picked up the new New Order CD, had a hot chocolate at Cafe Nero, then went for a walk by the river. After wandering through fields and trees for a while stumbled across a sculpture garden with a Caro and some Gormleys in. This set me thinking, and I scribbled away feverishly on various artistic ideas.  
The napkin my notes were on disappeared on the way home but I reconstituted the notes in my notebook. Hopefully I didn't lose any ideas. Then I put a stew in the oven for later, and blogged for a while.  
All in all a perfect day. Life, nature, music, art, food, and no hassle.  
Bliss. :-)
