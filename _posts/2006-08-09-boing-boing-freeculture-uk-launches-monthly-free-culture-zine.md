[Boing Boing: FreeCulture UK launches monthly free culture zine](http://www.boingboing.net/2006/08/07/freeculture_uk_launc.html)  
  
_Us at Free Culture UK and the folks at iCommons have have started to publish a monthly digest of free culture/commons related/copyfighting events going on globally. It's distributed across various email lists, and is also published by the Free Sotware Magazine. What's more, it's released under a CC-BY license and collaboratively maintained on the iCommons wiki so anyone can syndicate it, or add details of events._  
  
This is great, it's a continuation of the UK newsletter started by Tom Chance (that I did some work on occasionally as well :-) ).
