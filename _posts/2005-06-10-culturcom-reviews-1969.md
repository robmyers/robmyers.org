Ada Camara Ortega has written a review of my series "[1969](http://www.robmers.org/art/1969)" for the Danish website [cultur.com](http://www.cultur.com/cunst/):  


  
[1969](http://www.cultur.com/cunst/1969.html) (in Danish)  


  
Colour schemes from art & design of the 1950s to the 1980s were a strong influence on the images, so I think Ada's right to mention 1970s psychedelia and wallpaper designs. Evie even bought me a book of wallpaper designs after I produced 1969. :-)  


  
Thanks Ada!
