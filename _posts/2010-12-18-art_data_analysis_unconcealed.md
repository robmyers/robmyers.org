Unconcealed is an exemplary presentation of previously undisclosed data concerning the exhibition and collection of Conceptual Art in Europe in the 1960s/1970s and using it to study the social and economic networks of the history of conceptualism. It would be fascinating to see this kind of project for other artistic movements.
