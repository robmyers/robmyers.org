In the US a judge has declared a series of paintings illegal because of copyright. [They cannot be shown](https://twitter.com/#%21/joygarnett/status/50208162787246080) by their owners:

This will have a chilling effect on artistic production in the US. It's also deeply silly.

Permission culture and censorship may seem reasonable when they don't apply to you. But they're not.
