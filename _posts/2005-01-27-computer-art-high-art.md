Art computing before the launch of the PC was in a strange way guaranteed as high art by the simple fact that access to its means of production excluded the masses. The cost of computing machinery prior to the PC, and its location in fortresses of academia or business, guaranteed this. High art is high culture, the culture of the ruling class, not of the masses. So computer art, in a circular sort of way, must be high art, unless we create some sort of category of high folk art. :-)
