A proposal for a project I'm unlikely ever to do. A hyper-image Wiki based on SVG.  


  
The interface is SVG and JavaScript. Any element of any object is selectable. Groups get selected first.  


  
You can select any art and make a link to a new image, taking the art as the basis for the new image, uploading a new image, or starting with a blank image.  


  
You can make any selected art into a re-usable symbol.  


  
You can annotate, tag and externally link any art.  


  
Each image or symbol has its own history, diff and discussion page.  


  
Ideally, the interface would eventually be a full vector art editor, or at least allow for external vector art editors through an open API.
