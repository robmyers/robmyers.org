paintr is now beta. That means I'm going to leave it running for a while to check that it works OK, then come back to it in a few days to finalise the supporting HTML.  


  
The original hack took a morning, the Java applet took about a day, but getting the damn thing working online has taken ages. This is why I don't like writing software for public performance.
