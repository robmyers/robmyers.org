The drum track has static and scratches. This is the lowest level of the music suffering the most basic ironisation. Static/scratches on vinyl are also inherently rhythmic.  
Instruments are obvious samples retaining their recording (spatial and temporal) quality, or made too bright/bassy to ensure distance (ironisation).  
The vocals are brought close, their raw qualities emphasised, the edges sent of the top of the meter.  
Gavin Turk's rusty mirrored cubes.  
Fiona Rae (no noise, though?).
