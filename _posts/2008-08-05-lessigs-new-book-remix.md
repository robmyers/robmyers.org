Lawrence Lessig is finishing off his series of Free Culture books later this year with "Remix".  
  
See [here](http://lessig.org/blog/2008/08/coming_this_fall_remix.html) for details.  
  


<blockquote>_Dedicated to Lyman Ray Patterson and Jack Valenti, it pushes three ideas -- (1) that this war on our kids has got to stop, (2) that we need to celebrate (and support) the rebirth of a remix culture, and (3) that a new form of business (what I call the "hybrid") will flourish as we better enable this remix creativity._</blockquote>

  
  
It's available for pre-order now.
