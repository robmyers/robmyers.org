[Bela Emerson](http://cellobela.com/)'s cybernetic cello performances are excellent. New album out soon!  
  
[Brad Sucks](http://bradsucks.net/) is mis-named. His college-radio-friendly Beck-ish rock wouldn't normally be my cup of tea but it's BY-SA and it grows on you.  
  
[Amanda Palmer](http://whokilledamandapalmer.com/) is, fortunately, not really dead because her debut solo album is great.  
  
And on the retro front I've been enjoying Tangerine Dream and The March Violets...
