I'm probably porting **_Draw Something_** back to Lisp. And I'm porting **_ae_** (the toy aesthetic description generator) to Lisp to use as the basis for the art knowledge-base (ontology) that the programs will use. I've decided to start with colour, and as there's no rational basis for colour choices, the program will be called **_Goethe_**...  
  
[Sourceforge](http://www.sourceforge.net/) haven't approved rob-art yet. It's a shame that [Lipparosa](http://www.lipparosa.org/) doesn't seem to have come to anything...
