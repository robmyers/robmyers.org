It's ten years since "Fuse 94". I was there, an art student at a typography conference, and it was great. The best speakers were definitely [Letterror](http://www.letterror.com/), whose work on smart fonts influenced my work quite majorly.

I spent lots of time in the lab as well, making some Psychetecture in PhotoShop amongst other things. It was the first time I had my work put on the web (and the first time I'd been on the Internet). I don't have the files any more, they wouldn't fit on a disk then and the site isn't there now.  
  
People still use the word _"vernacular"_ too much. Vernacular to postmodern graphic design is like Pastoral to yBA art: a displaced, ironised aesthetic social virtue masquerading as an aesthetic.
