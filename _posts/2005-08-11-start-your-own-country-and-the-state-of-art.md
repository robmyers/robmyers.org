At the Fortean Times convention a few years back I bought a book called "How To Start Your Own Country" from Counter Productions. It's a good read.  


  
I started a country called "Art". So when people asked "what is the state of art?" there would be a definitive answer. The flag, the map of the country and the country itself are a Malevich square. The currency and the coat of arms are also black squares. The law is aesthetics. The national drink is absinthe.  


  
If anyone wants joint citizenship, or if any other countries out there want mutual recognition, email me. :-)  


  
update: I found the original project. It wasn't a Malevich square, but that's a better idea than the original flag so I'm going to change that and upload some stuff.
