A beautiful and entertaining board game to download from Remix Reading:  


  
[Monster Mash Board Game](http://www.remixreading.org/node/649)  


  
Best of all it's Free, being under the Creative Commons Attribution-Sharealike licence.  


  
Games are a classic example for "open sourcing": people can improve the rules & add their own counters. An open version of a card game like "Magic" would be great.
