So a while ago Newsgrist blogged this:  
  
[NEWSgrist - where spin is art: The "November" Matrix: Art, Theory, Criticism, Palaver](http://newsgrist.typepad.com/underbelly/2006/04/the_november_ma.html)  
  
And I laughed and remembered [A&L;'s 1970s call for the editors of October to be killed](/weblog/2005/03/23/art-since-1900/) but I didn't think any more of it.  
  
Then on Thursday I went to the Frieze Art Fair and Koenig Books had an actual print copy of November. I bought it and read it and it's very, very good. Like the best parodies it would be easy to confuse with its subject if it wasn't so funny. Some of the essays would have made for a nice Sokal hoax if they'd been submitted to October itself.  
  
If you can find a copy do pick it up.
