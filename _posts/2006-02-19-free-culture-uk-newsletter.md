Free Culture UK are starting a bi-weekly newsletter for free culture events and information of interest in the UK. We need your event announcements, article links, and news alerts. We're getting the first one together here:

If you're involved with something that isn't listed then this is down to ignorance rather than malice on our part, so help us fix it! If you don't want to hack the fc-uk wiki, email Tom Chance, email me, or email the fc-uk list and we'll put your item in if it's relevent.
