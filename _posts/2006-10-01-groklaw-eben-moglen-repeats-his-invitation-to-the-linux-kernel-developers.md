_ For my colleagues and fellow citizens who develop the Linux kernel, I have nothing but respect. I ask them please to join the conversation that is going on, to listen to others whose views may not be theirs, and to help the community make the best possible choices about matters of deep common concern._  
  
[And PJ Responds To One Of Moglen's Critic ](http://www.groklaw.net/comment.php?mode=display&sid=20060930140129423&title=Eben%20Moglen%3A%20%20A%20Renewed%20Invitation%20to%20Kernel%20Developers&type=article&order=&hideanonymous=0&pid=485350#c485368)  (This is BY-NC)  
  
_He is saying he will listen, but if they tell him to  
water down the GPL, he isn't likely to go along. That  
really is the problem.  Linus has now said publicly  
that only one of the GPL's 4 freedoms matter to him.  
I doubt that Moglen will go along with that. That  
doesn't mean he hasn't listened. It means Linus has  
a lot of nerve to even say something like that._  
  
_That's my view. This is, in my opinion, the  
enterprise trying to take over or muscle the  
GPL. I doubt they will succeed, but they do  
seem to  be trying.  Let them stay with  
v2 if they want. I don't care. But to try to  
sink the GPLv3 ship if they can't have what they  
want is not right. The enterprise probably  
hated v2 and still do, if they had full choice,  
but it's too late. Too many programmers use it  
and they are stuck with it. But it was rms that  
designed the GPL and he had a purpose, and  
the purpose is one that the enterprise finds  
inconvenient to the bottom line._  
  
_I am happy to see that Linus  
has modified his earlier statements and now  
says use the GPLv3 if you want to.  He is to  
be commended for that. The whole thing needs  
to be toned down, in my view, and I hope  
that attempt continues.  Obviously, Moglen  
is trying to work for a compromise solution,  
instead of firing back, "You're another" or  
something childish._  
  
_Moglen is addressing here the issue that they are pretending they didn't get to  
participate or weren't listened to.  I know for a fact that they wanted  
Linus to participate, and while I read Linus now  
saying things like, "they know my email" I can  
tell you from personal, first hand participation  
that I stood on my head to get his participation  
and I know others did too.  The problem was *never*  
that the FSF didn't want him to participate._
