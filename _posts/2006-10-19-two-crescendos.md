" What about it, what about it, what about it ?  
Oh, I'm pissing in a river. "  
- Pissing in a river, Patti Smith.  
  
" I'm gonna be somebody, I'm gonna get on that train, go to New York City,  
I'm gonna be so bad I'm gonna be a big star and I will never return,  
Never return, no, never return, to burn out in this piss factory  
And I will travel light.  
Oh, watch me now. "  
- Piss Factory, Patti Smith.
