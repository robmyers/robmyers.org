Some good news on the BY-SA/FDL compatibility and Wikipedia relicencing fronts:  
  
[Resolution:License update - Wikimedia Foundation](http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Resolution:License_update)  
  
[ Progress on license interoperability with Wikipedia](http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7876)  
  
[Some important news from Wikipedia to understand clearly](http://lessig.org/blog/2007/12/some_important_news_from_wikip.html)  
  
[And the Slashdot discussion about this is a good mixture of FUD and answers as usual](http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/12/01/2032252)  
  
The FSF moving towards BY-SA/SFDL compatibility and Wikipedia moving towards relicencing are all very good news.  
  
An unexpected effect of all this seems to be renewed calls for BY-SA to have "stronger" copyleft, which would be a good thing if possible. It's time to put aside legalistic objections (which have never been raised against NC's conception of use) and community objections (which amount to a defence of breaking the social contract of copyleft) and try to move to stronger copyleft for BY-SA.
