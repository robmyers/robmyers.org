All of my public back-catalogue is now available as Open Content, with the exception of "Surgical Strike" which will remain closed and "The Cybernetic Artwork Nobody Wrote" which will be cleaned up and released under the GNU GPL.  
  
"Blobs" includes the graphical elemsnts used to construct the images, so it's particularly good for sampling.   
  
"1968" will be Open Content when it's finished, as will "Arrows", my next project. "Got To Start Somewhere" and my other software projects including Minara will be under the GPL.
