Greg London's "[Drafting The Gift Domain](http://www.greglondon.com/dtgd/)" is an excellent introduction to the legal basis of Free Culture. Greg takes a nonpartisan look at the history, development and current state of copyright and patent law (in America), the recent development of Copyleft and why some licenses are better than others for ensuring the development of what he calls the "gift domain". Well worth a read.
