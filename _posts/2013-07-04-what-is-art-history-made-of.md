I was very flattered to be asked by Dr. Charlotte Frost to become involved in the 3D printing side of her "[Art History Hashtag](http://hasharthistory.net/)" project. My "shareable readymades" project was in part a reaction to the treatment of artisans by post-conceptual artists such as Jeff Koons, so reversing the artist/artisan relationship from that project and becoming the person modelling the artwork appealed to me. Charlotte's writing about the physicality of art history media touched on something I have thought since I was at art school. And I love typography and hashtags, with varying degrees of irony.

Charlotte has now written about her inspiration for the project, providing a context not just for her immediate work but for any classical or digital humanities that wish to cross over with Maker Culture and/or to engage productively in a critique of the ways that their own medium specificity and physicality are implicated in their production. It's an informative and valuable insight into the production of art and art history. I highly recommend it.
