== Subject Matter ==  
  
This forum will focus on 'open content', that is works such as books,  
music, and films which are provided under terms that allow for free  
access, redistribution and re-use.  
  
Open 'content' it would seem is everywhere what with Yahoo announcing  
there were over 50 million web pages licensed under Creative Commons,  
Microsoft teaming up with the British Library to digitize 100,000 out of  
copyright books (under the aegis of the Open Content Alliance), and the  
BBC piloting the Creative Archive project which will make large sections  
of its back catalogue available for free online.  
  
The forum provides a chance to discuss these dramatic changes as well as  
to ask important questions such as:  
  
* What exactly does 'open' mean? Does it mean 'full' freedom to  
access, redistribute and re-use or are restrictions such as those in CC  
non-commercial licenses allowed?  
  
* How should we promote the creation and distribution of open content?  
  
* Who will be producing open content and how will it be funded?  
  
* Will there be an 'open content' revolution  
  
* To what extent do monopoly rights such as copyright hinder, or  
help, the development of open content?  
  
= About the Open Knowledge Forums =  
  
'''Promoting open information - getting it, using it, sharing it'''  
  
The Open Knowledge Forums are a series of informal gatherings centred on  
the subject of open information/data. It aims to bring together those  
/producing/ and those /campaigning/, and to cover everything from  
software to the law. The sessions are usually held in the evenings in  
London and their format is to have talks by three or four different  
people followed by a general discussion.  
  
The Open Knowledge Forums are organized by the Open Knowledge
