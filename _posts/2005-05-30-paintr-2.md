**How I made this image.**  
  
I found a palette at colr called Scheme 5435 with the following tags: vermont, forest. and searched for those tags on flickr.  
  
I found an image at flickr called [Stream in the New Forest]('http://flickr.com/photos/11681861@N00/16308466/') by dbphotos which had the tags brockenhurst, newforest, hampshire, may, 2005, and I traced that using autotrace.  
  
I then applied the colr palette to the autotraced flickr picture in my own unique way to make this finished image.  
  
I hope you like it!
