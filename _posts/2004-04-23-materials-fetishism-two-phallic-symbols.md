Pencils seen used by animators in documentaries on Disney, Pixar, and The Simpsons:  
(Tuscan Red?) Berol Verithin   
Staedtler Mars Lumograph  
Sanford Black Peel-Off China Marker (!) Yep, Glen Keane...  
Mirado Black Warrior  
Mirado Yellow  
  
The lead pencils often have coloured erasers on the end, even those with integral erasers.
