I've added a [Dogecode](/2014/12/23/dogecode/) runner that uses [dogepartychain.info](http://dogepartychain.info/)'s API rather than requiring a local dogepartyd instance to be running. You can get the runner as part of the Dogecode source code here: [https://github.com/robmyers/dogecode](https://github.com/robmyers/dogecode) And you use it like this:

dcrunw DFibwNZvuJaHM9bD6x1WA63urkHiE4tWzF

which will fetch the program encoded as Dogeparty tokens at the specified address (DFib...) and run it locally. Here's some addresses to try:
