I like the pictures in A New Kind Of Science but it's low on my list of things to actually read. I think Wolfram is going to be digital art's Baudrillard. Shudder. My least favourite part of NKOS is the New Kind Of Copyright License Wolfram has at the start of the book. Hint: Wolfram either doesn't know about, or is choosing to ignore, fair use/fair dealing. Actually that's not true, his treatment of Matthew Cook makes that pale into insignificance.  


  
Anyway, this brings us to the most wonderful review of NKOS that I've read in a while:
