Hackers and Painters is out. It looks good. I'm just waiting for Amazon.uk to get my copy past the tachyon projectors.  
  
[Wired has a good review](http://www.wired.com/news/infostructure/0,1377,63506,00.html?tw=rss.TOP)  
  
Sample chapter, "[hackers and painters](http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/hackpaint/chapter/ch02.pdf)" (pdf).  
  
[See the book site](http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/hackpaint/index.html) for more details and reviews.   
  
More Paul Graham essays can be found on [his web site](http://www.paulgraham.com/).  
  
Now if he can just get on with Arc... :-)
