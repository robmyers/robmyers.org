**paintr** (nee Artomator)  
Inspired by [autodr](http://pallit.lhi.is/autodrawn) and in response to Harold Cohen's "[Off The Shelf](http://www.kurzweilcyberart.com/aaron/pdf/offtheshelf.pdf)".  
Colour handling from Cohen's "[Colouring Without Seeing](http://www.kurzweilcyberart.com/aaron/pdf/colouringwithoutseeing.pdf)".  
I'm going to do this in PHP.  
  
The procedure is:  
Get colour palette from colr.  
Expand colour name tags using wordnet.  
Find matching image at flickr.  
Posterise and autotrace image to SVG (autotrace).  
Sort colours by brightness.  
Choose light-to-dark or dark-to-light.  
Add background colour box?  
Colour image.  
Serve as SVG.  
Add log of concept expansion and matching as text (colour names, tags, wordnet expansion, flickr search string, matches, choice)
