I'm back to hacking on [Minara](http://minara.sourceforge.net/), which means I'm actually following my schedule for the year. I've added code to handle transforms and I've streamlined and improved the buffer & window code. I hope to have the code in CVS next week. Transform tools, colours, groups and a decent pen by next summer. Hopefully.  
  
I'm also getting ready to do more work on [rob-art](http://rob-art.sourceforge.net/). I'm just trying to learn Lisp's packaging system at the moment, as asdf seems overkill. The next program, called "huey", will handle colour. It will build on [ae](http://rob-art.sourceforge.net/rob-art/ae.html) 's ontology. I'm reading an interesting [paper on colour perception and naming](http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/view/417) at the moment, and Harold Cohen was kind enough to send me a JPEG of a wonderfully colourful current AARON picture when I emailed him recently.
