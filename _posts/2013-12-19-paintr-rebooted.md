![paintr](/assets/2013/12/paintr-1024x648.png)

I've updated paintr for the 2010s. It's now implemented in node.js running on OpenShift and posting to tumblr.

paintr's new address is http://paintr-rebooted.tumblr.com/ .

The images are inline svg, which displays well on the main page and in the individual article pages. If you follow the blog (please do!) the images don't show in the previews on your dashboard. Clicking through displays the images properly.

I'm wary of using proprietary and cloud web services. In this instance the source code and generated art is available, so it could be rehosted easily.
