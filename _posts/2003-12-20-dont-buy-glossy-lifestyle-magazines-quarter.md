"Adbusters" were unimpressed by "MTV" not showing an advertisement for "Turn Off Your TV" week.  
  
I propose "Dont' Buy Glossy Lifestyle Magazines Quarter". Glossy magazines peddle homogenized culture, leech cash and waste time. They propagate unreality more intimately than TV, and are more tailored to demographics. They are a threat to private space and shared reality and another pointless spend.  
  
I can't wait to see an advert for it in "Adbusters".
