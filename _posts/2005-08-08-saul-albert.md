Saul runs the [University of Openness](http://twenteenthcentury.com/uo/index.php/).  


  
He applied Open Source ideas to art very early on:  


  
[Open Source and Collective Art Practice](http://chinabone.lth.bclub.org.uk/~saul/docs/mirrors/saul/os.htm)  


  
And thought generative art through in an art history context, which isn't done anywhere near often enough:  


  
[Artware](http://chinabone.lth.bclub.org.uk/~saul/docs/mirrors/saul/artware.htm)  


  
I met Saul at Ways of Working Two where he was running a UO workshop, which was cool.
