As well as interviewing me for the FSF magazine, Matt Lee has been helping me move to a new, GNU, laptop. So I'm typing this in Ubuntu on a Lenovo Core Duo. Matt gloats blogs about this [here](http://exploringfreedom.org/2007/12/07/rob-myers-joins-the-free-desktop-revolution/), and I explain more in the comments.  
  
But basically GNU just works for me for my art, design and programming work now.
