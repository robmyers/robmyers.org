"Common sense isn't". So what should we make of [OpenMind](http://commonsense.media.mit.edu/cgi-bin/search.cgi)? Thousands of statements of common sense input by contributors (then licensed, ugh), available either in their [raw format](http://commonsense.media.mit.edu/cgi-bin/download.cgi) or as a [computer program](http://web.media.mit.edu/~hugo/conceptnet/).  


  
The GPL-licensed raw statements have the gnomic banality of so much conceptual and net.art that making art using the dataset is irresistible:  


  
_A box can hold things_  


  
_A flag is for displaying in public the political group of the owner of the flag_  


  
_A goldfish is a type of carp that makes a nice pet_  


  
_A lawn is a place outside where grass grows_  


  
_A nightgown is a long, loose garment worn to bed_
