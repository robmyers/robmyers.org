**Notes from "What is an image"**  
  
Appendix 2 in particular...  
  
AARON keeps a list of co-ordinates for each figure as it is drawing it,  
  
 and can access this should very precise intersection be required.  
  
That version of AARON has a maximum of 32 figures.  
  
It marks line cells in various ways. Outline, shading, dividing line &c.;  
  
 this kind of rich information might be good to keep.  


  
** Notes from "How To Draw 3 People..."**  
  
p9 for drawing speed, tighness, sampling rate rules.  
  
Skeletons are mapped into the matrix as marked cells.  
  
Do figurative drawings still use ntermediate destinations?  


  
** Notes From "Further Adventures"**  
  
Finished outlines are closed. All contained cells are claimed by the figure.  
  
Matrix resolution is set by (hi-res) monitor resolution, eg 1280 x 1024  
  
The "did not seem to be anything on the shelf" quote is from here.
