Get the GPL 3 licenced version of paintr 0.2 from here:  
  
[http://paintr.robmyers.org/paintr_0.2_GPL3.zip](http://paintr.robmyers.org/paintr_0.2_GPL3.zip)  
  
rob-art (including draw-something) and minara will follow assuming that there are no problems with any of the libraries I have used. In particular I will probably have to retire the Carbon version of draw-something (which has severe bitrot anyway).
