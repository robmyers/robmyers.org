An Open Content Art host. This is great. But it explicitly requires that all work be Noncommercial, rather than allowing a choice of license. Noncommercial is less Free than allowing commercial use, and grows less value (less art in this case). Hopefully they'll allow people to choose their own license soon.   
Ideally there'll be a "ContentForge" for Free Culture projects soon like the Sourceforge site for software projects today.
