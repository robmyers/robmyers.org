Did he let you down  
In the end  
Did you know where  
He was taking you  
Did you hope to  
Turn again  
Did the tiger  
Say his name  
  
And when I see him  
I'll ask him again  
And when I see him  
I'll ask him again  
And when I see him  
I'll ask him again  
And when I see him  
I'll ask him again  
  
Did you hope to see  
The morning sun  
Did you see through  
What you'd begun  
Did you know  
Or understand  
Was he there to  
Hold your hand  
  
And when I see him  
I'll ask him again  
And when I see him  
I'll ask him again  
And when I see him  
I'll ask him again  
And when I see him  
I'll ask him again
