I'm looking at colour palette generation for paintr and draw-something.  


  
Various mathematical systems:

The usual colour-wheel oriented schemes, plus a scheme that seems based on swapping the RGB values, and a map colouring system I haven't figured out yet.  


  
And there's also many image palette extractors, such as the one at praystation I can't find just now.  


  
Paintr could use other flickr images for colours, but that would remove the folksonomy element.
