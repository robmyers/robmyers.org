[You can't say what we think, by Jingo!](http://www.iconoduel.org/archives/2005/04/000594_lemon_harangue.php)  
  
To paraphrase: how dare a foreigner complain about "Art Since 1900", criticising pseuds is anti-intellectualism, never mind the ridiculousness feel the earnestness, think of the children, etc.  
  
Update: It's not just me, then:
