[http://www.kazushi.info/](http://www.kazushi.info/)[   
  
](http://www.design.kyushu-u.ac.jp/~osamu/)Kazushi Mukaiyama seems to have been a student of Harold Cohen's, and is working on his own drawing program, "[Shizuka](http://www.kazushi.info/modules/works/shizuka_01/index.html)". Where AARON imagines its own world, Shizuka seems to be more observational. The early source code of the random-walk turtle and the class diagrams for a later design were very influential on me when I started working on draw-something, as was seeing someone work through their ideas. (If the above link comes up in Japanese, go to the main page and click on the little US flag).   
  
Kazushi's blog is great fun, interlacing useful algorithmic insights and links with pictures of food he's bought and is about to cook. :-)
