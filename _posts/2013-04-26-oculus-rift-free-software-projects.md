Although the Oculus Rift SDK isn't itself free software, there are already a number of projects that use or replace it that are.

Three.js includes an Oculus Rift demo:

There's a class for using the Rift with the polular Ogre 3D environment:

EOS3 is a virtual desktop environment:

Vireo Perception is a Direct X ( :-/ ) hooking stereo driver:

And in fact there's lots of good stuff on Github generally (search for "Oculus Rift"):
