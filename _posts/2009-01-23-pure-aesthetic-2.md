New work from 2007 -  
  
[/art/pure_aesthetic](/weblog/2007/06/27/pure-aesthetic/%20/weblog/2007/06/27/diamond-dust/)  
  
Photos of salt cellars (and a pill bottle) with diamond dust.   
  
This developed from the ideas presented here -

The salt cellars are a reference to Duchamp and to cocaine. The diamond dust is a reference to Warhol and Hirst. In real life rather than on a screen print diamond dust is a disappointing grey powder, a worthless industrial scouring agent. It's the gap between its real and imagined value and its real and imagined aesthetic impact (as well as how it does sparkle when you dust a print with it) that makes it interesting, critically speaking.
