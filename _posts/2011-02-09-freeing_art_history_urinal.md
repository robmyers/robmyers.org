I commissioned the ultra-talented [cwebber](http://dustycloud.org/) to make a 3D model of a urinal suitable for 3D printing and signing. It's licenced under the Creative Commons [Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported licence](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/). Here's a picture of it:  
  
[![urinal.png](/assets/assets_c/2011/02/urinal-thumb-400x352-83.png)](/weblog/2011/02/09/urinal.png)You can download the original Blender file [here](/git/?p=urinal.git;a=blob;f=urinal.blend;h=c55a04ee64ff4eb3267e05726bfafa2e828713fd;hb=bd365bc8db80deb943cd56052eeef4728e37a003).  
  
And there's a version suitable for 3D printing available for download [here](/git/?p=urinal.git;a=blob;f=urinal.x3d;h=cad050efe5887da3f787cdbf2c4f4e97afcd636e;hb=bd365bc8db80deb943cd56052eeef4728e37a003).  
  
Which you can also download from thingiverse [here](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6261).  
  
(You'll need to scale it to fit your printer.)   
  
If you don't have a 3D printer yet, you can order a 3D print of the model from Shapeways [here](http://www.shapeways.com/model/212121/). If it's too large/expensive you can upload and print a smaller version.  
  
Next I'd like to commission a 3D printable model of a glass ampoule suitable for containing a small volume of air from a town such as Paris...
