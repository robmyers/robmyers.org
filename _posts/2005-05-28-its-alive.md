I've moved my site to a host that can handle running projects like paintr, and I've upgraded this weblog to wordpress.  
  
I've converted my iBlog weblog using Agitprop, but there are problems with the conversion. I've fixed most of them, but some images haven't been moved over. I'll fix this tomorrow, and get a better theme then as well.

Update: Fixed most of the agitprop problems, but accented characters have been converted to their nearest English equivalent. :-(  New theme forthcoming...
