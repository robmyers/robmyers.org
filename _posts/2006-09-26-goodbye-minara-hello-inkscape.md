Writing Minara has been a positive, if occasionally frustrating, experience for me. It's precisely the wrong way to write a graphics program but it works surprisingly well. I've gained a lot of insight, and made something unique.  
  
But it's that uniqueness that limits its utility to others and means that I'm unlikely to find support for it. So I'm looking at switching to Inkscape. Hopefully the experience I've gained writing Minara can help add some interesting stuff to Inkscape and create something like the interactive environment for graphics coding that Minara was designed to be.
