Here's Pipe in [Furtherfield](http://furtherfield.org/)'s show "[The Human Face of Economics](http://furtherfield.org/programmes/exhibition/human-face-cryptoeconomies)", along with Urinal and Balloon Dog. You can [buy one from them](http://www.furtherfield.org/artdatamoney/shareablereadymades/) along with a certificate of inauthenticity.
