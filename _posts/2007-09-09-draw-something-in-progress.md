It's up to 700 images. A 400 Mhz G4 takes a couple of minutes to create a drawing. I may just run it to 1000 rather than 2048, which will probably take until some time tomorrow.  
  
So far the images that work are reasonably diverse. The images that don't work tend to be just a few dots or lines on a plain background. The colours aren't working as well as they seemed to in the test application so I'll have to find out why that is.
