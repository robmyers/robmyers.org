[Minara](http://minara.sourceforge.net/) is sticking with OpenGL; adding an intersection callback stopped the crashes. I've cleaned up the buffer and window code, and started working on code to support transforms using PostScript-style matrices for speed (2x3 rather than 3x3). You can also save buffers now (type x,s). The C cleanup can wait. I need to think some more about transforms, and also about dialog-style interactions with the user. Minara needs to prompt for filenames and to display colour choices and other dialog functionality. I don't want to reinvent the wheel, but I do want something that will look good and be fast for power-users to operate.
