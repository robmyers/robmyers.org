Orange, the CC-licensed Blender movie, is ramping up pre-production and looking good. The project now has a blog and you can pre-order the DVD. I used to use the example of DVD extras for animation as something that should be Free. Orange is providing source materials and even the code they write for effects.

Now if I can just persuade Paramount to make Star Trek Free then all of my examples will be actual. :-)
