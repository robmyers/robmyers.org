First ever minara drag! I used the select tool (s s) to select the green (minara) graphic, then used the move tool (t m) to drag the red selection. Now I just need to get the code working for moving the original graphic when you release the mouse.  


  
The red selection is actually the green graphic's future position. It would be tortuous to split the main buffer around selections and re-unite it afterwards. So this is how we do it.
