The excellent Greg London has a new book on Free Culture and Free Software out:  
  
_I just uploaded a first draft of my new book,  
"Libre Labyrinth" to my website.  
  
While working out some issues with what an  
Open Hardware license would need to be comparable  
to the GNU-GPL, I came up with a Venn Diagram  
that describes how copyright, patents, functionality,  
DRM, and other concepts can affect a FLOS project.  
  
It turns out that this diagram ends up being a  
completely objective way to describe, compare,  
and contrast any sort of license, without resorting  
to subjective terms such as "Free" or "Libre" or  
"Open Source".  
  
The book also goes into a brief discussion of scalability  
of a project, which is independent of the license  
you choose for your project. The section on scalability  
discusses issues such as Brook's Law, where it does and  
does not apply, parallel versus sequential tasks, and  
the amount of overhead added to a project per person added.  
  
It's about 80 pages and is licensed CC-BY
