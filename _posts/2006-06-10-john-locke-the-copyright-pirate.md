[John Locke the copyright pirate](/weblog/wp-admin/http3A2F2Ftom.acrewoods.net2Fnode2F432)  
  
An excellent presentation by Tom Chance that takes on All Rights Reserved with Arrrr! Locke's work on the commons and property is foundational, and Tom's claim that Locke would hoist the jolly roger if faced with contemporary excesses of intellectual property is a convincing one.  
(Disclaimer: There's a quote from me in there, in the context of why artists shouldn't expect to be paid directly for every possible use of their work.)
