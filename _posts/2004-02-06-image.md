In cultural studies, all the world's a text and all the men and women in it are but signifiers. Art is a poor cousing of text, as text is more like text than art is.  
In computing, when a program is copied from memory to a disk so it can be restored later, it's called an image. When an entire computer disk is copied for a backup or to be moved to another computer, it's called an image (or sometimes a mirror). Programs do have "TEXT" sections, but those aren't the important bits.  
So hackers have ot it right, anyway. :-)
