Public good (German models of Wikipedia).  
  
Human activity (culture).  
  
Graft (in the sense of unpaid working and networking towards a paid goal).  
  
Social capital (irreducible to markets).  
  
Deontological realism (we are "tenants of culture").  
  
A value spiral (build and cash out).  
  
Any more?
