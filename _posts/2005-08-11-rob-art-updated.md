The new version 0.2 of rob-art is now available at:  


  
[http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/rob-art/](http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/rob-art/)  


  
Version 0.2 adds a more freehand-looking pen and random colour to draw-something.  


  
If you just want to run draw-something on MacOS X 10.3 or MacOS X 10.4, download the draw-something-carbon.dmg package instead. It will clear your screen to a blank white then have a think for a few seconds before starting drawing. Press command-q to quit the application once it's running.  


  
This is the version of draw-something that was shown at O3one.
