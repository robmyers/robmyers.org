Tom had some kind words for my series 'San Jose':

[Shoutbacks](http://www.digitalmediatree.com/tommoody/?32426)

and mentions [Ryan McGinness](http://www.ryanmcginness.com/) and [Anton Vidokle](http://www.artfacts.net/index.php/pageType/artistInfo/artist/8574) . Neither of whom I'd heard of, and both of whom are very good. Ryan in particular offers the challenge of more visually complex work, one that I feel I ought to rise to.
