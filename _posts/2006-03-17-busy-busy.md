So I went to help out at [Remix Reading's open access lab](http://www.remixreading.org/node/716) two Saturdays ago.  
  
On Tuesday I met up with the extremely cool [Jon Philips ](http://www.rejon.org/)of Creative Commons (amongst other projects). Then I discussed Ken Wark's "Hacker Manifesto" (buy! buy!) with [Tom Chance](http://tom.acrewoods.net/). Then I discussed free culture with Dave.  
  
On Sunday 19th March I'm hoping to get to Cory Doctorow's last [Copyfighters' drunken brunch](http://craphound.com/000615.html) in the morning then to [Dorkfest](http://www.dorkfest.org.uk/) in the afternoon where I'll be talking about draw-something.  
  
On Thursday 23rd March I'll be talking about my work and discussing art computing with the panel at [Cybersalons's Creative Software conference](http://www.cybersalon.org/creative_software/index.html).  
  
Then on Saturday 8th April it's [fc-uk's practical free culture meetup](http://www.freeculture.org.uk/meetings/2006-04-08), where I hope to talk about free art. I believe I am the first artist to have had an all-copyleft solo show (corrections in the comments section please :-) ).  
  
So this is why I am not blogging very much at the moment. :-)
