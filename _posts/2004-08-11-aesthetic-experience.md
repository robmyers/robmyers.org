(From Aesthetics-L)  
  
Aesthetic experience is reflective awareness of the discovery or rediscovery of an engaging pattern in chunked sensory input combinded with memory by right-brain abstract global pattern-matching systems.  
  
Reflective = awareness of consciousness available to consciousness.  
Engaging Pattern = one that appeals to the organisational principles of the brain, rewarding its work.  
Chunked Sensory Input = sensory input processed in some way by the brain, anywhere from properties to signs. This may involve different "levels" of perception, but is still perceptual.  
Brain Structure = Whatever the brain does to structure information.  
Right Brain Abstract Global Pattern Matching System = See any bad left/right brain self-help book.
