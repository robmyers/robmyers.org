The Creative Commons 2.5 licenses are now live. Choose a license from:  


  
[http://www.creativecommons.org/license/](http://www.creativecommons.org/license/)  


  
and you get a 2.5 version.  


  
The only changes are the attribution provisions apparently requested by a mysterious quorum of wiki owners. These are open to abuse, they are unworkable outside of the US due to Berne's moral right of Attribution (which is inalienable in some jurisdictions), and are they *really* needed by the giant attribution databases that are Wikis?
