"Pipe" is a 3D printable model of a classic smoking pipe. It is the latest in a series that began with [Urinal](/urinal) and continued with [Balloon Dog](/balloon-dog)

Commissioned by me and modelled by the ultra-talented [Chris Webber](http://dustycloud.org/). Chris retains the copyright on it and has placed it under the [Creative Commons Attribution Sharealike 3.0 Licence](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/).
