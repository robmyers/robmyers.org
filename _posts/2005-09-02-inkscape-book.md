Inkscape is an excellent Free Software vector graphics editor, well worth a try. I've used and even written software for use with Illustrator for well over a decade now and whilst Inkscape still lacks a few vital features that Illustrator has, it's well worth using for its own good features and to get used to something new that shows great potential.
