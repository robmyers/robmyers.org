"Two software programs are created. Program A creates ?art data? which is transmitted to program B. Program B is programed in such a way that it has aesthetic criteria with which it evaluates Program A?s art data transmissions. The human witness doesn?t view the art data, but Program B responds to the art data in a way that is discernible by the human witness. "  
  
Kinda like a negative Turing test. A guy at Middlesex did unseen computer art before I was there, but this is a step beyond that. The producer/consumer pair reminds me of [ae](http://rob-art.sourceforge.net/rob-art/ae.html) from [rob-art](http://rob-art.sourceforge.net/), which was based on ideas from [Algorithmic Aesthetics](http://www.algorithmicaesthetics.org/).
