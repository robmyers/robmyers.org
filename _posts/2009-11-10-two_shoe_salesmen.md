The boss of a shoe company sent two salesmen to a new country to see whether there was any market for footwear there.  
  
The first salesman returned and gave his report to the boss. "Everyone there already has shoes, but if you try to change your laces you go to prison! That's terrible! We should make sure that doesn't happen here!"  
  
The second salesman returned and gave his report to the boss. "Everyone there already has shoes, and they are much more fashionable than ours. We should stop making shoes and make a deal with their manufacturer to be their franchise here! Think of the opportunity! We just have to sign one little contract!"  
  
And the moral of the story is - don't be like the first salesman! Embrace cool and opportunity!
