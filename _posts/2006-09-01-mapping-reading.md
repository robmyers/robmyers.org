I spent Saturday [mapping Reading for OSM](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/index.php/Reading). This consisted of walking around an estate with a GPS and Matt Lee from [CNUK](http://www.cnuk.org/). We did a depth-first search of the roads, and you can see our trace here in puce (I think it's puce, I thought it was purple but that doesn't look right. Tom?):

[OSM](http://www.openstreetmap.org/) is a brilliant project. I must see what needs doing around Peterborough.  


  
Matt and I talked about the need for a Free Culture Foundation, which I think he may be doing something about now, although in a slightly different form.
