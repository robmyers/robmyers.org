My 2000th post was [Fair Use Wins In Richard Prince Decision](/2013/04/27/fair-use-wins-in-richard-prince-decision/) , but I didn't notice at the time. Post 2001 was, fittingly enough, about [Billy Idol’s “Cyberpunk” Promo Floppy](/2013/04/28/billy-idols-cyberpunk-promo-floppy/) .

The first post on this blog, [Hello World](/2003/04/15/hello-world-2/) , was published just over ten years ago on April 15th 2003. So this is a double approximate anniversary.

Blogging helped me to practice my writing and promote my art. I wouldn't have become a Furtherfield reviewer without it. As the net moves on to shorter form writing in walled gardens, I think I'm going to stick with blogging.
