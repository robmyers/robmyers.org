[PooterGeek Â» Blog Archive Â» Running Rings](http://www.pootergeek.com/?p=2403)_I'd ascribe one other quality to crop circles that is lacking in most contemporary British art: they are (or were) genuinely subversive. Their delicious Englishness shows up graffiti artist Banksy for what he is: the art business equivalent of a rich white pop singer acting out a fantasy of being a poor black man._Amen.
