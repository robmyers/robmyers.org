Here's the first successful image created by the new composition system for draw-something:

The forms share some vertices because of the new composition system, and their colours relate because of using AARON's new colouring system. This is the third run of the new code: the first had a bug, the second wasn't interesting. So there's more tuning up to do, but this image shows how things will and can work.
