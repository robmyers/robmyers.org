Copyleft/sharealike is only a restriction if you want to impose restrictions. It is a ban on bans, a restriction on restrictions, it does not stop you doing anything, it only stops you stopping others. Comparing it to noncommercial or no-derivatives restrictions is bogus, and ideologically suspect.
