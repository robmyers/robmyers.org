This is a visualization of common colour names as they appear in the main twitter stream -  
  
![twitsthaetics.png](/assets/2010/06/19/twitsthaetics.png)This is just a screenshot, I'll show the live version when it's finished. The colours are placeholders and (although you can't see it) the animation needs improving. It's written in Processing using a Scala-based Twitter Streaming API library.If this works well I'll do shape and pattern ones. This is a follow up to "The Colour Of...", "Friending The Aesthetic" and "Random Aesthetics".
