_The reason why our plans for freedom work better than other peoples' is that they include a sequence of activities ” proof of concept, running code and the solicitation of partnership. First you make it, then it works, then you invite people to make it better._  
  
_Most of the people that have struggled for freedom have proposed a utopia ” "I know of a place that's never existed, but if we go there it will be better." It turns out that as a mode of constructing freedoms there are problems with that method._
