[Featherston Blog: Introducing Stone Free: Textures that cost nothing](http://featherston.blogspot.com/2006/07/introducing-stone-free-textures-that.html)  
  
_Today I am pleased to announce my new 'Stone Free' collection of seamless (tiled) textures. As the name indicates, the textures are designed to be used as stone material. There are currently 100 unique images in the collection, and I hope to begin adding more soon. All of the images are 100% free, and licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 2.5 license. You are not only encouraged to download these images, but to use them for personal or commercial use._  
  
Mitch is a one man army of openness! Elephants' Dream is BY as well, so you can mix these textures straight in with those models. These are excellent root projects for 3D work, and can be used in copyleft projects as well.
