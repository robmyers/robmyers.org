**How I made this image.**

  


I found a palette at colr called Scheme 6536

  


with the following tags: red. And searched for them on flickr.

  


I found this image on flickr: [Anamarie]('http://flickr.com/photos/34427470233@N01/1542/') by rogue drone (which had these tags: sister, baby, red, anamarie) and I traced that using autotrace.

  


  


I then applied the colr palette to the autotraced flickr picture in my own unique way, and that's this image.

  


  


I hope you like it!
