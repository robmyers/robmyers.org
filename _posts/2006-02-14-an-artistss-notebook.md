_Inspired by Ed Ruscha, I bought a Moleskin notebook to take notes on my paintings as I work on them. I was finding myself trying to remember things that I had done on previous paintings, and this way I can keep track of that stuff for future use._  


  
_After I finish something, I write down the color mixtures, and anything else I might need to remember. It's already come in handy at least once on this painting._
