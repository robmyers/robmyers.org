Boing Boing don't seem to be publishing my comment on their post here -  
  
[http://www.boingboing.net/2010/12/02/1895-viennese-archet.html](http://version1.europeana.eu/web/europeana-project/public-domain-charter-en)  
  
It's probably hit a link spam filter or something.  
  
**So here it is:**  
  
Scans of two dimensional images do not attract copyright in Germany -  
  
[https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Image_copyright_%28Germany%29#Two-dimensional_Originals](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Image_copyright_%28Germany%29#Two-dimensional_Originals)  
  
Even if they did, doing so conflicts with the Europeana Public Domain Charter -  
  
[http://version1.europeana.eu/web/europeana-project/public-domain-charter-en](http://version1.europeana.eu/web/europeana-project/public-domain-charter-en)  
  
And they certainly don't attract copyright in the US -

The Creative Commons non-commerical licences are *not* friendly, they are non-free -

And they are *copyright* licences. They cannot create restrictions on public domain works, which are out of copyright.  
  
Alexander Ferdninand WÃ¼st died in 1876, some time before 1895, and more than long enough ago for these images to definitely be in the public domain -

Given all this, please consider using the correct CC tool for these wonderful images -
