So it's coming up to 10am and the removal men have almost packed everything that's going. Evie's over at her new house with the Nag Champa that I bought her. Helping her move out has been like digging my own grave, only without the promise of any respite at the end. But at least I have been as good as my word. I don't really have anything else I can be.
