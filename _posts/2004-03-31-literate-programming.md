I've moved my [AARON](http://www.kurzweilcyberart.com/) -style program from [Prolog](http://www.swi-prolog.org/) to [Python](http://www.python.org/) to [Lisp](http://www.alu.org/) to [Dylan](http://www.gwydiondylan.org/), and now I'm programming it in a [literate programming](http://www.literateprogramming.org/) style using [noweb](http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~nr/noweb/). Literate programming means combining a human-readable description of the program with the code and using a program to extract the code and well-formatted documentation from this shared source. It's like illuminated manuscripts for code, and a technique I'd like to apply more directly to image programs (such as PostScript or MetaPost code).  
Hopefully the extra effort will be worth it:  
• Having to describe what I'm doing is helping me to think more clearly about what I'm doing.  
• This is a long term project, so the documentation will help me to start hacking on it again after any breaks.  
• I can present the program publicly, unlike with AARON.
