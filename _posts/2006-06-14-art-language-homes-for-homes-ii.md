[Art & Language : Homes for Homes II - Les presses du reel (book), 2006  
](http://www.lespressesdureel.com/EN/ouvrage.php?menu=&id=749)  
  
_This publication is built around an important installation "Homes from Homes 2" (2000-2001), which simultaneously references the development of Art & Languages's work over the decades and the collection of the Migros Museum fur Gegenwartskunst in Zurich, in which it is now included.  
Each element of the installation is described, annotated, and put in the context of aesthetic, theoretical, and political problematics through extended captions and essays by the artists._  
  
_Questioning the notions of conservation, of institutional politics, and the relation between art and its institutions, the publication is designed by NORM in close collaboration with the artists._
