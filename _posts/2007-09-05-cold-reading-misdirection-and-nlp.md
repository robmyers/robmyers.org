....are all potentially fertile areas for Artificial Intelligence research.  
  
Mediumship, conjuring and marketing all require an understanding and manipulation of human beings that contains a great degree of knowledge and understanding of the human condition. AI implicitly requires this as well, at least in its strong form or in forms that would recognize the Turing test.
