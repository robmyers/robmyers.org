I finished Gombricht's "The Story of Art" today. It's excellent, if a little pre-political-correctness in places.  
I particularly like the way he pulls out universals whilst showing a progression of ideas. I need to re-read it with a notebook (it's too good a story to treat as a study source on the first go).  
I should have read it years ago, but I was too busy reading Art&Language and various programming manuals. :-)
