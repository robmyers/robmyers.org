I found a small-press-produced booklet called "In The Making, Number 5 1878, A directory of co-operative projects" in my local Oxfam today. The copyright block ends:  


  
"Copyright (c) In The Making, 1978. Alternative publications may reproduce freely provided acknowledgement is made."  


  
This is clearly a predecessor to CC-BY-NC. It's important to note that when comparing CC to GPL, the GPL doesn't have to work to keep its resources within the community as the resources are code and the community are coders. So the "Alternative publications" bit may look non-free compared to CC's explicit support for moving work into other media and other communities, but I would argue that it is CC that is different here (although probably correctly so).  


  
The (c) was hand-drawn. :-)
