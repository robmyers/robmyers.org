[aesthetic computing book - data visualization & visual culture - information aesthetics](http://infosthetics.com/archives/2006/05/aesthetic_computing_book.html)  
  
One of the things that the better work in the Boredomresearch show drove home to me is that aesthetics and computation can be equivalent. This isn't meant to trivialise either, or reduce one to the other. But when shape grammars are Turing Complete and a 2D Turing machine is aesthetic, there's at least an interesting overlap between two domains that couldn't seem more different on the face of it.
