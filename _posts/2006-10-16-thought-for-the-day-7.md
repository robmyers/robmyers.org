_In my course I have known and, according to my measure, have co-operated with great men; and I have never yet seen any plan which has not been mended by the observations of those who were much inferior in understanding to the person who took the lead in the business._  
  
- Edmund Burke, quoted in the front matter of "The Open Society and Its Enemies Volume One".
