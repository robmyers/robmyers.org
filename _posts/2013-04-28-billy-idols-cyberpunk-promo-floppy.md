Billy Idols' 1993 concept album "Cyberpunk" (see [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberpunk_(album))) was ahead of its time in its production and promotion. It's the latter that I am interested in here. Idol gave out his email address, toured the online virtual reality communities of the day, and sent out a Macintosh floppy disk containing a multimedia introduction to the album along with the press pack.

You can find copies of the press pack available for sale online. Despite being written for the obsolete Macintosh II system, the software can still be run by copying the contents of the floppy using the GNU/Linux "dd" command and then running it using the SheepShaver Macintosh emulator (using an emulated 640x480 256-colour monitor).

It looks like this:
