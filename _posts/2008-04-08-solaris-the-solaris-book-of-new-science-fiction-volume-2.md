[Solaris - The Solaris Book of New Science Fiction: Volume 2](http://www.solarisbooks.com/books/newbookscifi2/newbooksf2.asp)  
  
They're not mentioning it in the publicity, but this collection contains the new Jerry Cornelius novella from Michael Moorcock, "Modem Times".  
  
I've started reading it and it's very good. Absolutely vintage Cornelius but with the quotes from Iraq now rather than Vietnam.  
  
If this blog post is threatening to mean precisely nothing to you, [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Cornelius) isn't much help. I will blog about Cornelius at some point, the stories are absolute classics.
