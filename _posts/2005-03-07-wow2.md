Ways of Working 2 was excellent.   
  
Favourite audience question of the day (paraphrased):  
  
"If you find a way for artists to legally copy other people's work, won't they just find something else transgressive to do?"  
  
Even better than the presentations was meeting people. I've never been asked "Are you the Rob Myers..." before, so having the experience a couple of times on the same day was cool. :-)  
  
Favourite comment from someone I met (paraphrased):  
  
"I thought you'd be a grumpy old professor [...] like Brian Sewell."  
  
Fortunately not. :-)
