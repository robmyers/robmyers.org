Philosophy is a product of leisure. Leisure implies a surplus, the more leisure the more surplus. A large surplus is difficult for an individual to produce. Which may imply exploitation. What is the ethical and class character of leisure and how does this impact philosophy? Does it require a Victorian ethos of different-kinds-of-labour (see the painting) to make it a product of (or producer of) work rather than leisure?
