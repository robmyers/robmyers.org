I was relieved to read Paul Graham's description of writing code in the debugger: that's how I write code. I've also recently enjoyed thinking up code then writing it once I know what I want to write, which is more the case with Literate Programming.  
Hacking is fun. It's the same deep, where-does-the-time-go engagement as making art. But contrary to what Neal Stephenson says, there's more than one way of doing it.
