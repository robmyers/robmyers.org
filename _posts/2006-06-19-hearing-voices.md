There was a very interesting documentary on Channel 4 (in the UK) this evening about hearing voices:

"Some scientists draw a parallel with forecasting the weather by creating a virtual weather system. The system is designed to have autonomy, so running the model produces results that the meteorologist wouldn't and couldn't have predicted on their own."  


  
Without wishing to trivialise hearing voices, I think this is relevant to generative art as an example of small systems or simulations determined entirely by human minds that can nonetheless surprise and inform them.
