[openbusiness.cc](http://openbusiness.cc/) have a questionnaire for artists at the moment. One of the questions is "Have you ever used a CC work without incorporating it into your work? E.g. listened to CC licensed music"  
  
Is this free-software-style concept of "use" of a cultural work a useful abstraction or a distortive import? Is it good to regard the consumption, propagation and creation of culture as "use", or is there better terminology to be had?
