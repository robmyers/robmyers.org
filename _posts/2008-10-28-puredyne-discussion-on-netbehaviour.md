<blockquote>_  
Marc invited two team members of the **GOTO10** collective, **Heather Corcoran** and **Aymeric Mansoux** to discuss about **pure:dyne** on the [Netbehaviour.org list](http://www.netbehaviour.org/)._  
  
_  
The discussion took place between October 16th - 23rd Oct 08. An  
interview and an open discussion was joined by other list members of  
Netbehaviour._
