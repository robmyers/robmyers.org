I just created my first Wikipedia article:  
  
[AARON](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AARON).  
  
I've got an entry on Harold Cohen in the works and I need to make the OGL entry more NPOV.  
  
Wikipedia really makes me think of A&L's Indexing projects of the early 1970s, as do folksonomies.  
  
What is the artistic equivalent of an ecyclopaedia (Wikipedia) or an operating system (GNU) ?
