[Deconstructing Roy Lichtenstein  
  
](http://davidbarsalou.homestead.com/LICHTENSTEINPROJECT.html)  
  
A side-by-side comparison of Lichtenstein's paintings and the usually far superior original frames from comic books.  


  
[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Lichtenstein) notes that: _Artist Dave Gibbons, who illustrated the graphic novel Watchmen (written by Alan Moore), said of Lichtenstein's works: "Roy Lichtenstein's copies of the work of Irv Novick and Russ Heath are flat, uncomprehending tracings of quite sophisticated images."_  


  
Lichtenstein's graphic design-inspired work is much better than his comic book-inspied work, though.
