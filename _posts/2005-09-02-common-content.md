[Common Content](http://www.commoncontent.org/) is back, with more admins to keep link spammers away.  
  
[Common Content](http://www.commoncontent.org/) is a directory of Creative Commons licensed content on the web. Register, submit a link to your content, and your work will be added to the directory. It's great for finding work that isn't in the big repository sites.
