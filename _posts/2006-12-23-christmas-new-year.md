I am going to be largely offline over christmas and new year. I have a Wiimote to play with from GNU/Linux and will be soldering up a sensor bar for it. I've also got some colour sensors when my soldering station arrives. I also have lots of reading to do and some thinking about exactly what to get up to next year.  
Have a good Christmas and new year.
