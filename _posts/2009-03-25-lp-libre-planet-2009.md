[Libre Planet](http://groups.fsf.org/index.php/LibrePlanet2009) was great.  
  
The FSF extended their annual get-together to two days this year and discussed free network services and their high priority projects as well as free software activism. It was held at Harward's science centre building, which was a great setting for rooms and for wifi but not so hot on food. ;-)  
  
I met lots of cool people, and I'm going to blog about what I learnt over the next few days. Before that I need to say a massive thank you to Benjamin Mako Hill for letting me sleep on one of his sofas, to Matt Lee for suggesting I attend the convention, and to the rest of the FSF staff for running such a well-planned and successful event.
