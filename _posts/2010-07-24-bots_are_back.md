I had to take the identi.ca bots that use my microblog-bot library offline for a while because an upgrade to status.net broke the underlying Lisp xml parsing library that it uses.  
  
I've now fixed microblog-bot and redeployed the bots, fixing some other bugs as well (the bots will say hi to you again if you message them).  
  
You can click through to the bots from these pages:

[Random Aesthetics](/art/random_aesthetics)
