"Gelvis", 1993. A Warhol Elvis gunslinger/ Gilbert & George photo-work mash-up. I like the Pierrot-like figure that emerges from the collision of gay iconographies. I also like the glitch halo and what happens to the perfect grid of Gilbert & George's work. This was made with morphing software on either Amiga or 286/386, I don't remember.  
  
What I've been reading about mash-ups sounds like the sort of cultural tweening I've always been interested in, maybe its time to get back to my roots and take this further. I don't know whether morphing software is appropriate, but it seems to be a good fit to the software used to shift and stretch sound for aural mash-ups.
