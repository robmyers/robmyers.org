[Should CC release software licenses? | Creative Commons](http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/6133)  
  
_It has been suggested that there would be some value in CC entering the field of software licensing. I am skeptical (there are plenty of software licenses) but the explosion of mixed code/content platforms (e.g., Flash) has led me to at least get feedback about the idea. So if you have thoughts about this, I'd be grateful if you could send them to software-licensing@creativecommons.org_  
  
Please email CC to oppose this. It's an interesting area but YAL is not the solution.  
  
Possibly CC could draft a GPL-3 exception to allow aggregation with BY-SA content?
