It is a truth universally acknowledged that a Creative Commons licenced blog that quotes other sources is not placing them under a CC licence.  
  
It is also a fairly well known fact that most blog reader don't understand this any better than they understand any of the rest of copyright law.  
  
So I believe that blogs that quote often should say something like "Original content under a CC licence" or "My writing under a CC licence". Like this one used to and will again when I fix it.  
  
This would stop people, say, copying an Ursula K Le Guin story believing it is CC licenced.  
  
It wouldn't stop them copying it under the four-step Fair Use system of course, but that is a different matter.
