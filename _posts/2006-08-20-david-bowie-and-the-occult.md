[David Bowie and the Occult](http://user.cyberlink.ch/~koenig/bowie.htm)  
  
_To some degree all these personae are re-creations of the Pierrot figure, a disguised Gnosis in the form of parody. Bowie has repeatedly appeared on stage (and still stages) as the 'Pierrot in Turquoise', a sort of a Threepenny Pierrot (the colour turquoise connoting "the British symbol of everlastingness" as one of his early teachers gnomically recollected)._  
  
Moorcock's "Cornelius Chronicles", one of the few pieces of literature produced in England in the second half of the twentieth century, also treats life as a harlequinade. Amongst other things. I must post about Cornelius at some point.
