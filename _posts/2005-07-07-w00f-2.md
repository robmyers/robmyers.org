Software patents kicked out:  


  
[http://swpat.ffii.org/log/05/ep0706/](http://swpat.ffii.org/log/05/ep0706/)  


  
The future will see more struggle over software patents in Europe: each country in the EUEUEUE can do its own software-patenting thing, software patents weren't explicitly banned, and you just know the companies that were disappointed by this outbreak of democracy will be back.  


  
But that doesn't matter for now. Because this battle was won.  


  
Hah.
