I have a piece of work in the latest issue of Truck, curated by [Alan Sondheim](http://www.alansondheim.org/):

[http://halvard-johnson.blogspot.com/2014_04_01_archive.html](http://halvard-johnson.blogspot.com/2014_04_01_archive.html)

It's a Bash script called Pome, you can read it and its output here:

The script downloads the text of the Project Gutenberg CD and searches for mentions of poetry and related concepts, gathering together assertions about them. Originally I started using Python, but Bash ended up being easier to use. It serves as a demonstration of the strengths and weaknesses of Digital Humanities approaches to text and to fear of them.

I like the output, particularly the last piece.
