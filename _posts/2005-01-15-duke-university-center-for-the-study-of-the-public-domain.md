Duke University (home of Parapsychology) have a Center For The Study Of The Public Domain.

I'm not a big fan of the public domain. I think it works just about OK for text, but it's bad for images and worse for music and moving images. A decade ago I could photograph paintings in state-funded galleries in London, but now I would have to pay for reproductions that come with restrictive licenses attached. It's good to see serious thought about the limitations and future possibilities of the public domain.
