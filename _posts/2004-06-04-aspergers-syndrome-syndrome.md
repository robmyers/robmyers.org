Michaelangelo is the latest victim of Asperger's Syndrome Syndrome. This is where a publicity hungry psychiatric hack assigns a pathology to someone famous using the famous bullet-point-comparison test.  
  
Hopefully some day a cure will be found for the poor individuals who suffer from this syndrome syndrome. Or perhaps we'll find that their inexplicable drive to pathologise notable historical figures is a result of their work, not a mental disorder, however much it might look that way when you reduce it to a soundbite.
