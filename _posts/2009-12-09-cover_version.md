_"This is not my song to you and this is not me singing it,  
A cover version, words I found, dressed in black with eyes seductive,  
Eyes are mirrors of the soul, mirror mine I don't feel whole,  
I remember yesterday but someone else bought yesterday..."_

If software should not have owners, should songs? In what way are songs not instruments? In what way is the resonance of unique expression not a means for every individual to their own end?
