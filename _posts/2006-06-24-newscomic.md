[newscomic](http://dev1.manme.org.uk/~davem/RSScomic_1.2/index.php?input_rss=2)  
  
_newscomic recycles the news, re-mixes it, subverts and distorts it. It takes live news feeds (RSS feeds) from major news sources, chops them up at random and puts the resultant text into speech bubbles in a comic. The comic illustrations reflect the current latest news, and are regularly updated to keep up with the news. The result is a disjointed comic, where the words and pictures don't quite fit but make their own story._  
  
_Often the story is quite surreal, but can by chance make sense, and even be quite revealing. _  
  
Kinda like paintr for sequential art.
