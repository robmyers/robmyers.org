![Streaming Aesthetics: Shapes](/assets/sa-shapes.png)  
Here's the code for Streaming Aesthectics: Shape . You can compile and run it in Processing.   
  
[https://gitorious.org/robmyers/streaming-aesthetics](https://gitorious.org/robmyers/streaming-aesthetics)  
  
It follows Twitter to see when people tweet shape names and then draws those shapes, packing them inside each other.  
  
There's some unused code for more complex shapes, but "star" and "cross" appear in the Twitter firehose more often than geometric shape names.  
  
Next is Streaming Aesthetics: Pattern .
