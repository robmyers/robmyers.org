I'm not a US citizen so I've been staying out of the Orphan Works Bill debate for the most part. But I am getting more and more emails about it and reading more and more blog post about it. All are against the bill, so to balance this here are some pro-Orphan Works Bill posts:  
  
[Orphan Works Myths and Facts](http://www.publicknowledge.org/issues/ow/myths-and-facts)  
  
[Release The Orphan works](http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2008/05/release-orphan-works)
