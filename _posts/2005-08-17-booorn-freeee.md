I switched my iBook to Debian GNU/Linux as its main OS on Sunday after finally getting the ASUS wireless dongle working (Airport doesn't work under GNU/Linux). I've kept MacOS X Tiger on another partition, but the only time I've booted it since Sunday was to quickly get my RSS subscriptions out of NetNewsWire.  
  
I'm using BloGTK for blogging, GAIM for instant messaging, Firefox & Firebird for web & mail, and Liferea for RSS.  
  
I'm still using Emacs, Inkscape and Gimp. They're better under GNU/Linux than under the X11 system on MacOS X.  
  
The user interface isn't as good as MacOS X, but with GNU/Linux that's up to me. Freedom and responsibility, it's a groovy combination baby, yeah!
