Hot on the heels of its appearance at "[The Human Face of Cryptoeconomies](http://furtherfield.org/programmes/exhibition/human-face-cryptoeconomies)", [Facecoin](http://robmyers.org/facecoin/) is featuring in the "[Trading Floor](http://networkcultures.org/moneylab/program-3/conference-sessions/)" exhibition at [Moneylab2](http://networkcultures.org/moneylab/) on Thursday 3rd and Friday 4th December 2015 at Pakhuis De Zwijger in Amsterdam.

Lots of great people are speaking at the event, and I'm very proud that Facecoin is part it. You can find out more in Femke Herregraven's awesome [programme booklet](http://networkcultures.org/moneylab/2015/11/23/moneylab-program-booklet-is-finalized/).
