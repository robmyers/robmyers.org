I wondered if there was an instruction manual for police sketch artists. The only thing on Amazon that I can find is an American book by an expert:  
  
[Mug Shots](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0873645723/)   
  
I'm interested in this because it may provide a facial ontology for drawing software and some way for me to improve my face-drawing skills.
