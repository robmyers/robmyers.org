If you could register for Second Life and put your referrer down as "Yarrel Fox" that would be great.

What?  


  
Uh.  


  
Second life is interesting because it simulates a strong IP regime. Indeed since property in the game is intellectual property, there is no difference between IP and physical property in the game. It has a monetary system, and this in tandem with the IP/property system works to incentivise creativity as promised in real life. This is the perfect example of something proving what it's meant to prove. But it also, unintentionally, shows just what a consensual hallucination any kind of property system is.  


  
That's Y-a-r-r-e-l F-o-x. Thanks. I get a thousand Linden Dollars for each referral, you see.
