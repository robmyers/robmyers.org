_[...]culture is a shared endeavor. Artistic innovation, creative communities, culture - none could work without an open commons of access and sharing. (Did Susan Meisalas pay the Catholic Church for her depiction of the cross, or Pepsi for depicted its trademarked can?)_  


  
_An absolute lockup of a creative work - requiring advance permission and payment to use or re-use - is not only impossible in the digital age. It flouts the social identity of art works. A work has no meaning or emotional resonances without a social community. And future progress requires access and re-use._
