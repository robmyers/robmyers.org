[NEWSgrist - where spin is art: Artists' Rights or Copyright Extremism? Miro Estate vs. Google](http://newsgrist.typepad.com/underbelly/2006/04/artists_rights_.html)  
  
I meant to blog this but Joy does it better. Moral Rights seem a very important concept to reconcile with Stallmanian Freedom (or Fair Use), but Stallmanian Freedom (or Fair Use) is also a very important concept to reconcile with Moral Rights.  
I don't really see why the Miro estate are objecting to free advertising. But then I'm a living artist, so what do I know? :-)
