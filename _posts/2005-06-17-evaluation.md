Things to stop holding back on:  


  
• Hardware hacking for art visuals, especially games consoles.  
  
• Custom 'display' hardware.  
  
• Textual descriptions of work.  
  
• Mash-ups and sampling.  
  
• 'Expanded pixels'; art quark systems (a la AARON's cells / n-d space & various space systems), retro-style bitmap & icon references, and realworld/artistic quantization.  
  
• Game engines & 'Second Life'.  


  
Things to spank:  


  
• Managerial ('Relational') Aesthetics.  
  
• Decorativeness.  
  
• "Committed" net.art .  
  
• Art as advertising (GPS art...).
