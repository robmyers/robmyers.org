_Behold, the legendary Chart of Fantasy Art! (2008)_

_Every year we ask our summer intern to do a survey of cover art elements
for the top  fantasy novels published in the previous year. This year,
our wonderful intern Jennifer looked at covers from 2009, and compared
them against 2008â€²s findings.  Over the next few days we'll be releasing
a number of charts that show what she found._
