In 1941 Franklin Roosevelt gave a speech in which he outlined four freedoms. They're different from Stallman's. :-)  


  
[The Four Freedoms](http://www.libertynet.org/~edcivic/fdr.html)  


  
_The first is freedom of speech and expression --everywhere  
  
in the world.  
  
The second is freedom of every person to worship God in his  
  
own way-- everywhere in the world.  
  
The third is freedom from want, which, translated into world  
  
terms, means economic understandings which will secure to  
  
every nation a healthy peacetime life for its inhabitants  
  
--everywhere in the world.  
  
The fourth is freedom from fear..._  


  
This is basically a statement of human rights, after Wells but before the UN.
