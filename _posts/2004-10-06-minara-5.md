I've checked the latest version of Minara in to SourceForge. The basic window, buffer and tool systems are now running well, and I've written a toy pen tool that doesn't always crash GLUT's polyline intersector. ;-)  
  
I'm going to get back to Minara in December or January for a major clean-up of the buffer code, converting the rendering code to using LibArt, and reformatting the C code to follow GNU coding standards.
