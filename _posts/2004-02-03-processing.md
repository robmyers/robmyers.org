Dave Bausola recommended "Processing" to me. Processing is the sequel to [DBN](http://dbn.media.mit.edu/), and if you know java or JavaScript/ActionScript you already know it. [Ed](http://www.soda.co.uk/members/ed.htm) from [Soda](http://www.soda.co.uk/) is using it to write [moovl](http://www.sodaplay.com/), the sequel to [SodaPlay](http://www.sodaplay.com/).   
I've had it on my hard disk for a while now but I'd not really had a look at it. It took me all of an hour to be writing three-dimensional animations in it this evening. I'll be converting [The Cybernetic Artwork Nobody Wrote](/art/cybernetic) to Processing, and I think I'll do Ghosts/Subjects using it as well.
