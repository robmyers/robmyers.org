Grab the flv, mp4 or mov format versions of every episode so far of Where Are The joneses? from The Internet Archive:

These should be better for playing online and for remixing, mashing and generally mucking about with. I think it should help with podcasts and Democracy TV as well. Take a look and get involved in scripting the next episodes.  
  
If people want different formats then ask (or, even better, offer) in the forums:

But bear in mind that VLC is very good at playing and converting different formats for you.  
  
Let a thousand Joneses bloom!
