I love the fact that [Processing](http://www.processing.org/) defaults to giving you the source when you publish work with it. This means that you get to see how work like this is created:  


  
[Gallery of Computation](http://www.complexification.net/gallery/)  


  
[Dataisnature](http://www.dataisnature.com/) linked there a while back.  


  
Source code is the preparatory sketches of art computing.
