Copyright is an account of the value of art. It is a descriptive system, and is meant to be a complete system, it even accounts for the (lack of) value of work outside its scheme.  
  
This makes copyright an aesthetics, or at least an analogue to aesthetics. This may be one of the reasons why it is of interest to artists and to philosophers.
