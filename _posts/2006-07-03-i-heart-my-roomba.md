I like my [roomba](http://store.irobot.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2172860). It actually works. Occasionally it gets stuck under the sofa, but that's only because I don't use the light barrier thing. The kids are a lot happier tidying their rooms for the robot to vacuum than for me to vacuum.  


  
There was an old Isaac Asimov story about the introduction of humanoid robots. People couldn't handle them, so the company scaled back to selling little fruit-fly catching autonomous flyers and other obviously beneficial non-threatening devices to socially engineer attitudes towards robots. I think that the roomba is just such a project. iRobot, the manufacturer, also make military robots.
