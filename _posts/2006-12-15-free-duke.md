Sun have made Duke "Free graphics". His graphics are BSD licensed (not BY...), and some are Illustrator postcript files which are a bit difficult to load. So here they are converted to SVG:  
  
[Duke SVGs](/wp-content/uploads/2006/12/duketar.gz)  
  
One has some bad artefacts on Duke's-actually what is that? A nose? An eye? Anyway, the red blob isn't very good on one of the images. If anyone can fix that let me know.  
  
See [Duke's homepage](https://duke.dev.java.net/) for more info, 3D files and more images. No idea how Duke's freedom interacts with his trademark status. Someone should definitely produce some Duke pr0n to see how this works. ;-)
