A ninja ambushes a pirate in a hail of shuriken. The pirate ducks behind a mast, blocking the shuriken, as his parrot flies at the ninja squawking obscenities.  
The ninja reaches for his nunchaks to dispatch the parrot, and the pirate takes a swing with his cutlass. But the moon suddenly shines across the deck from between two rocks off the coast of the island, and the ninja melts away into the fleeing shadows.
