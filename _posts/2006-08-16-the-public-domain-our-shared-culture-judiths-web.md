[The Public Domain: Our Shared Culture: Judith's Web](http://opendomain.blogspot.com/2006/08/judiths-web.html)  
  
_Shown in this 1972 image is Lexington, Massachusetts, high school student Judith Miles, who discusses her proposed Skylab experiment [...] called "Web Formation in Zero Gravity,"_  
  
Not quite space art, but close enough.
