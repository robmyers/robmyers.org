The beholder gazes at the artwork, disinterested, finding immanent and unmediated emotional experience contained within it.  
The consumer views the artwork, their discourse unreflectingly illustrated by it.  
The participant renders the artwork, engaging with it to generate the experience of it. Canvases are scene-graph scripts or interactors.
