I have placed my soul on the blockchain, representing it as a cryptographic asset token.

The MYSOUL token is on the Dogecoin blockchain as a Dogeparty asset:

I've divided it up into 100 units. This is more efficient that having a single token to represent the soul and transferring it to a single owner, as competition within the market will both reduce costs and allocate this resource more efficiently than a [monopoly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Komar_and_Melamid#History) could.

To make ownership of my soul more accessible, I've also created a MYSOUL asset on the Bitcoin blockchain with Counterparty:

This is also divided up into 100 units. Counterparty is more expensive for transactions than Dogeparty, but is more widespread, so it's good to have both options.
