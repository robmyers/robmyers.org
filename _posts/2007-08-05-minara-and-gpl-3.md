minara uses a few small but very useful utility functions from the ttn-pers-scheme project, which seems to be GPL 2 only with no timescale set for upgrading to GPL 3.  
  
I'll email the author to ask if the next release will be GPL 3. If so, I will hold off on making minara GPL 3 until then. If not, I will re-implement the functions. I know that's not very "clean room", but hopefully it will be OK.  
  
I'm not meant to be doing any more work on minara but I really would like to fix the outstanding bugs and do a 0.0.1a release at some point.
