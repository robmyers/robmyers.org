I'm back from Tunisia. It's an excellent place. I filled a sketchbook whilst I was there.  
  
Got lots of rest, lazed around the beach and the hotel pool, went to Soose and Monastir, ate far too much. I didn't go to the Sahara with Evie and Tom, though.   
  
I've come back to find the MacOSX Tiger DR waiting for me and my email inbox limit exceeded (!).
