When I'm at an art show I'm going to review, or as soon as possible after leaving it, I take notes. These may be taken in low-light conditions, on the last train of the night, under the influence of complimentary alcohol, or in otherwise sub-optimal conditions. But they tend to have an immediacy that the finished review replaces with more in-depth reflection. So as an experiment here are scans of the notes for my review of "Neurotic and the PVCs" at the ICA and "SwanQuake: House" at v22. Excuse my scrawl.[](http://flickr.com/photos/robmyers/sets/72157612019632395/)
