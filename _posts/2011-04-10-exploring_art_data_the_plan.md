I've been very, very busy recently and I haven't had time to work on the "Exploring Art Data" series of blog posts.
I will get back to them. First I will finish the Graves Art Sales exploration. Then I will use Joy Garnett's images of her paintings as an example of processing a (small) large dataset. Then I will analyse the Netbehaviour mailing list archive as an example of a social network.
And that's the plan. Unless anyone has anything else they'd like to see.
