[Free culture in action - Exploring Freedom with Matt Lee](http://exploringfreedom.org/2008/06/free-culture-in-action/)  
  


<blockquote>_My band, furny, have released all the tracks from our two EPs as free downloads. They've been available elsewhere, including Last.fm and for sale as CDs for a while.  
  
We're putting them all up on the web and encouraging people to download, listen and if they like.. donate.  
  
I don't expect many people will donate, but I do hope a lot of people will download them. We're encouraging people to file share them, and even to make their own CDs and sell them, for profit, and not share that money with us.  
  
Why? Because it's all great publicity.  
  
Want to make your own furny t-shirts and sell them? Great Let us know.. we'll link to you  
  
Want to make your own furny CDs and sell them in your record store, or online store? Fantastic.  
  
Using furny music in your game, or movie? Awesome  
  
We're even including a bundle of someone else's artwork in each download -- with 1999-2005 EP you get CC Ironies and with more mature escapades in hi-fi, you get Canto -- both of these by Rob Myers, a friend of the band after he wrote a nice little write up on our licensing._</blockquote>
