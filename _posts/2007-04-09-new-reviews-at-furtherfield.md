I have two new reviews up at Furtherfield:[Scanpath - Catherine Baker](http://www.furtherfield.org/displayreview.php?From=Index&review_id=221)[The Sheep Market - Aaron Koblin ](http://www.furtherfield.org/displayreview.php?From=Index&review_id=220)These are both CC-BY-SA-3.0, my first 3.0 works. I will relicence my art under 3.0 when I get the chance, but you can place derivatives of it under 3.0 anyway thanks to the upgrade clause in the 2.x licences.
