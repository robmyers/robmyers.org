I met so many new people at Libre Planet that I cannot remember all of them. I also finally met Mako, Evan, Kat, Mike and Asheesh physically for the first time, after six or seven years of online contact in some cases. But due to a combination of jet lag and convention duties I hardly got to talk to any of them. I must do better next time...
