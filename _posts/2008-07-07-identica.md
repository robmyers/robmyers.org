[Evan Prodromou](http://evan.prodromou.name/)'s new project [identi.ca](http://identi.ca/) may look like just a twitter clone that signs you out if you don't post anything for a few hours but don't be fooled. It is in fact a giant leap forward for the freedom to use Internet-based software.  


  

  * The code is AGPL, so even if someone tries to modify it to lock users' data in to the modified version, the users have access to those modifications.
