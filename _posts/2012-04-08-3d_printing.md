Finally taking [my own advice](http://rhizome.org/discuss/view/17561/), I've bought a [MakerBot Replicator](http://store.makerbot.com/3d-printers/replicator.html) and I'm using it to print out my art.  
  
It takes about ten hours to print a [Balloon Dog](http://www.furtherfield.org/projects/balloon-dog-rob-myers):  
  
![Large Balloon Dog](/assets/large-balloon-dog.jpg)The print quality is fascinating. It's incredibly detailed and smooth, but it looks like it has been woven from a single long thread (which in a way it has) which gives it a very finely serrated quality.  
  
I'm uploading pictures of work in progress and finished prints to MediaGoblin, [take a look](http://mediagoblin.com/u/rob/)!
