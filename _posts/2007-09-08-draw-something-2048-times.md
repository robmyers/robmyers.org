I've just started a version of draw-something running that is going to generate 2048 images. I wonder if it will be finished by Monday?  
  
I'm going to go through the images and see what works and what doesn't. I'll modify draw-something to make it more likely that it will produce images that work and less likely to produce images that don't.  
  
The first results indicate that just dots on a plain background really doesn't work. ;-)
