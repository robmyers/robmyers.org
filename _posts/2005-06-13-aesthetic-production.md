The review of Ranciere's and Badiou's respective aesthetics in Radical Philosophy 131 complains that neither tackle capitalism head-on.  
  
  
  
This is both vital (ignoring capitalism renders aesthetics irrelevant or distractive) and pointless (capitalism is atmospheric, and already distorts and redirects everything else).  


  
Possibly this should be double-whammied; render capitalism aesthetic, and aesthetics capitalistic. This would be neither Naomi Klein nor Walter Benjamin, rather an analysis of the projective geometry of exchange value.
