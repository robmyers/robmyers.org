serpent-mode is a [GNU Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) major mode for editing and compiling [Serpent](https://github.com/ethereum/serpent) code.

Serpent is a Python-inspired language for writing smart contracts that compile to [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org) Virtual Machine bytecode. It adds syntax highlighting and indentation for Serpent code, and allows files to be compiled from within Emacs.

You can get the serpent-mode here:

Some of the indentation code has been borrowed from Emacs' built-in Python mode but any deficiencies are a result of my simplifying it to work with Serpent. Reports of errors and omissions gratefully received.
