I have two new Free Culture-related reviews up at Furtherfield.  
  
[Abstract Hacktivism](http://www.furtherfield.org/displayreview.php?review_id=307)  
  
_A book collecting two essays by Otto von Busch and Karl Palmas transforms the concept of "hacktivism" with well-argued historical analysis and a number of informative case studies._  
[  
Big Buck Bunny](http://www.furtherfield.org/displayreview.php?review_id=306)  
  
_"Big Buck Bunny", the second short film from the Blender Foundation, features well animated cartoon animals trying to kill each other in order to advance free software and free culture._  
  
Both of the works under review are excellent and well worth downloading and/or paying for.
