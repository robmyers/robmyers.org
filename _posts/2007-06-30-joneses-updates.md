The Where Are The Joneses website has been improved based on comments from people who have been using it:  
  
[http://www.wherearethejoneses.com/](http://www.wherearethejoneses.com/)  
  
The wiki in particular is now much easier to use:  
  
[http://wherearethejoneses.wikidot.com/](http://wherearethejoneses.wikidot.com)  
  
Also Loca Records have posted about their involvement in the project:  
  
[http://www.locarecords.com/](http://www.locarecords.com/)  
  
And [Dave](http://zeroinfluence.wordpress.com/) showed the first few episodes at CC Salon London on Thursday night to general laughter in the right places:  
  
[http://ccsalon-london.org.uk/](http://ccsalon-london.org.uk/)  
  
So this is it! Participatory, free media that is building on contributions and existing work.  
  
**Come and get involved!** You don't have to write a whole episode, just add an idea to the wiki:
