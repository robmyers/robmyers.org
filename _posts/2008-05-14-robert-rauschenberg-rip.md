[Robert Rauschenberg, RIP - Boing Boing](http://www.boingboing.net/2008/05/13/robert-rauschenberg.html)   


<blockquote>Robert Rauschenberg, a pioneer of multimedia art in the truest sense of the phrase, died last night. He was 82.  
</blockquote>

  
Rauschenberg's work had a massive impact on me when I first arrived at art school. His art was high stakes aesthetics in which either everything was transformed into art or... But it was always transformed into art. Rauschenberg convinced me that freedom was not only possible but worth pursuing in art, and that art could transform any materials while still (or possibly thereby) retaining a link to real life.
