![late_king.png](/assets/2011/01/19/late_king.png)In "The Sale Of The Late King's Goods" (Macmillan, 2006, ISBN 1405041528) Jerry Brotton surveys the inventories, invoices and auction records of the art collected by King Charles I.  
  
This isn't quantitative analysis of art data but Brotton does use the use of data such as the purchase dates, prices and other hard facts of Charles's art collection during his life and after the King's execution to drive and underwrite the dramatic narrative of artistic and political history.
