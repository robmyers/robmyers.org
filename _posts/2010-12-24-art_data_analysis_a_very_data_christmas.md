<blockquote>_I thought it would be fun to explore
the lyrics of Christmas carols, and see how the word usage in these
songs compares with today's lexicon.  To do so I needed two things:
first, Christmas carol texts; and second, a way to compare the usage of
words in those songs to that of today._</blockquote>

<blockquote>_A simple Google search for Christmas carol lyrics [yielded this site](http://ldsguy.tripod.com/Christmas.carols.html), which I downloaded into a single text file.  Then, I used the R `[tm](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tm/index.html)`[ package](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tm/index.html) to [create a clean word corpus from this text](https://github.com/drewconway/ZIA/blob/master/R/Very%20Data%20Christmas/very_data_christmas.R), stripping out English stopwords, punctuation and case.  This left me with 755 words to explore._..
