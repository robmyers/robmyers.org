A freeloader complains about Magnatune introducing a nagware policy for their noncommercial offerings:  


  
[Magnatune: We're not as evil as we could be](http://business.newsforge.com/business/05/11/16/1458249.shtml?tid=33&tid=132)  


  
If you don't want a company to introduce nagware, buy their products once in a while.  


  
Magnatune show either great chutzpah or the negative effects of speed reading by misrepresenting Lessig and Stallman to claim that noncommercial nagware is helping to build the commons:

Ugh.  


  
There are many fine copyleft record labels who are building a real cultural commons. [Loca](http://www.locarecords.com/) and [OpSound](http://www.opsound.org/) for example.
