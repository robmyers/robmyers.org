[internet soul portrait - data visualization & visual design - information aesthetics](http://infosthetics.com/archives/2006/08/internet_soul_portrait.html)  
  
_an intriguing set of illustrations that represent web designs as pure structural representations_  
  
Any designer worth their salt will sketch out a web page design, in pencil or pen, as blocks before they go anywhere near a computer screen. I'd like to see those sketches, but these illustrations are a good insight into the compositional design of web pages and are very cool in themselves.
