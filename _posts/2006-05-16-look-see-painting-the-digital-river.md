[Look, See: Painting The Digital River](http://www.chrisashley.net/weblog/archives/week_2006_05_14.html#001413)  
  
I saw this book a little while back but haven't had a chance to read it yet. It looks like a study of art from the Paintbox end of the spectrum rather than the code art end, but in a genuinely engaged way. The Paintbox is the only genuinely modern (technical) form of painting. If he were alive today Leonardo would use one. So what prevents most "serious" artists from picking up a Wacom and engaging with the medium?
