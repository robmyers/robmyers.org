![TimeDIff_SUM_ALL_color_reduced.jpg](/assets/2010/12/24/TimeDIff_SUM_ALL_color_reduced.jpg)Lev Manovich's Software Studies initiative at UCSD is applying big data quantitative methods to mass media in a technique called Cultural Analytics. I particularly like their studies of US Presidential campaign ads (image above) and of manga images.  
  
If art is the superstructure of kitsch or if an artist is an aesthetic summator then this is paradigmatic art, using the techniques of the age to depict the visual environment as renaissance artists used trade maths.
