_Making media- any media- is expensive. It requires substantial up front investments in time and manufactured goods to create, duplicate, and distribute anything. The courts' easy reliance on a not-for-profit standard for fair use ignores the reality that artists, no matter what they choose to do, need to support themselves and their work with a return on their investment just like everyone else. The currently applied 'nonprofit' standard simple assures that only the independently wealthy may dabble in fair use._  
  
An excellent essay on Fair Use by Negativland that is equally relevent to NC
