Copy, Rip, Burn  


  
Free, Libre, Open Culture  


  
Showcasing art/film/music inspired by the Libre Manifesto. Due to be unveiled in late 2005. Contributions from Artists, Authors, Filmmakers and Musicians and to be toured in Galleries internationally end 2006-2008  
  
Work can either be based on a single section of the manifesto or more generally inspired by the entire text. We particularly welcome work that uses the text of the manifesto in interesting ways, in effect deriving art from the text-work.  


  
The Project  


  
The aim is to allow both the project itself and the artworks to be decentred in production. You are welcomed to sign up to the mailing list at  
  
[http://libresociety.org/mailman/listinfo](http://libresociety.org/mailman/listinfo)  
  
or even start your own to work collaboratively. Create Wiki pages to develop this project and to help manage it as they are needed.  


  
The format as unspecified but naturally it seems logical that free formats would be better.
