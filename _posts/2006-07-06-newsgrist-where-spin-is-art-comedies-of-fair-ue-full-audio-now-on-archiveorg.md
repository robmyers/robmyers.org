[NEWSgrist - where spin is art: Comedies of Fair U$e: full audio now on Archive.org](http://newsgrist.typepad.com/underbelly/2006/07/comedies_of_fai.html)  
  
_The entire Comedies conference (audio) is now available at Archive.org for listening and for free download, thanks to Fred Benenson who had the time and energy, not to mention the know-how, to clean-up all of these mp3s and get them up online.

This is the conference where Joy discussed her "Joywar" with the photographer who took the original image. This cuts to the heart of the ideas of appropriation and artistic responsibility, and is a must for anyone interested in free culture.
