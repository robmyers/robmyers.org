NODE.London [Networked, Open, Distributed, Events. London] is committed to  
building the infrastructure and raising the visibility of media arts  
practice in London. Working on an open, collaborative basis, NODE.London  
culminates, in its first year, in a month long season of media arts projects  
across London in March 2006.  
  
The NODE.London Reader (surveying art, technologies and politics) projects a  
critical context around the Season of Media Arts in London March 2006 and  
provides another discursive dimension to the events of October 2005's Open  
Season. It engages debates in FLOSS (Free/Libre and Open Source Software),  
media arts and activism, collaborative practices and the political economy  
of cultural production in the present day. It includes essays and artist  
projects from Sabeth Buchmann, Toni Prug, Armin Medosch, Simon Yuill, Chad  
McCail, Critical Art Ensemble, Jo Walsh, Richard Barbrook, Michael Corris,  
Harwood, Agnese Trocchi, Matthew Fuller, Rasmus Fleischer and Palle Torsson,  
Brett Neilson and Ned Rossiter, Matteo Pasquinelli and Francis McKee. It is  
available at a range of NODE.London public events throughout March, and as a  
POD (Print On Demand) through the website. Check the website for further  
outlets as they become available, as well as news and additional texts.
