[Dennis Hollingsworth: Artists in Hiding](http://www.dennishollingsworth.us/archives/001665.html)  
  
  


<blockquote>_This image can get you killed in some parts of this world. The truth of this statement should be enough to compel a closing of ranks in the entire art community to defend the freedom of the artist who created it. But much of our art world is silent about it, hiding in plain sight._</blockquote>
