[[cc-licenses] Getting to Version 3.0](http://lists.ibiblio.org/pipermail/cc-licenses/2006-May/003557.html)  
  
Mia Garlick, CC General Counsel, announces the proposed CC 3.0 timeline. If you are interested in Creative Commons and wish to be involved in the 3.0 process, do subscribe to cc-license-discuss.  
  
FDL compatibility isn't in 3.0, which despite having fought hard for I have mixed feelings about, hopefully the "other way" Mia mentions will be better. And I'm not sure about an icon for "right of integrity" in strong moral rights jusrisdictions, but this is better than the current, implicit, situation. The generic licenses and the clarifications for various parties all sound great, and I'm really excited about the drive to clearly identify the "free" licenses.  
  
Here's to 3.0!
