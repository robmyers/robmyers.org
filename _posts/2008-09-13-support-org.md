ORG, the Open RIghts Group, are the UK equivalent of the EFF (differences in law and political culture aside).  
  
They have been doing excellent work over the last couple of years; getting into government consultations, bringing issues to the attention of mainstream media, observing electronic voting, and giving Andy Orlowski something to wring AdWords revenue from.  
  
You can help support ORG from just five pounds a month. Having been to ORG HQ I can vouch that they are a lean and mean outfit and that your money won't be wasted on bean bags or lava lites.

If you're in the UK and you're interested in Free Culture you should support ORG. Don't make me name names, people. ;-)
