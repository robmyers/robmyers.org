36f1: A given multidimensional intrinsic motivation space will intersect the complement of a given multidimensional affordance space.

95a1: A multidimensional extrinsic motivation space is a non-affine projection of the former.

187e: Dimension-reducing extrinsic motivation space is a (mathematically!) degenerate projection of that.

0ecb: Monodimensional extrinsic motivation space (...money) is a (mathematical!) singularity.

f61d: (Points, badges and awards are as extrinsic as cash. Intrinsics may be culturally or historically determined or influenced.)

9833: Topological extrinsic motivation spaces with extrinsic motivational singularities are perverse (...incentives) to a degree that is a function of the relation of their centroid to that singularity.

cfe6: Extrinsic value command and market economies are (pretty much affine) reflections of each other, as they themselves argue, given this.

747a: Libertarian/market anarchists and socialist anarchists are probably extrinsic/intrinsic anarchists.

1c85: Intrinsic motivation may be learnt. Extrinsic motivation may be projected.

e2f5: Neither intrinsic nor extrinsic motivation is avoidable. They may complement or clash.
