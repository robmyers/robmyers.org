"[The Owls Map](http://www.ghostbox.co.uk/theowlsmap.htm)" by Belbury Poly is very good. It's the synth music you almost remember from your 1970s schooldays (even if you didn't have them) but with undercurrents of The Wicker Man. Tangerine Dream, Jarre, Kraftwerk, they're not English but they are from the same logical universe as Tomorrow's World and complement the incidental music-style warmth and whimsy of some of the other reference points of this sound. There's also hints of the evils of morris dancing and just a dash of real old folk sung by real old folk . The production is cleaner and less radiophonic workshop this time. I preferred the more analogue sound quality of "The Willows" but this is good stuff. Music with its own mythology and a rich, nuanced sound. Ghost Box are definitely onto something.
