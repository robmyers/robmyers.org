The FTP archives and homepages of the 1990s may be gone but some of the
best known MU*s are still there.
You can connect from the command line using Telnet.
LambdaMoo:
telnet lambda.moo.mud.org 8888
MediaMoo:
telnet mediamoo.cc.gatech.edu 8888
FurryMUCK:
telnet muck.furry.com 8888
On modern GNU/Linux distros, Telnet may not be installed by default. You
will need to install it. e.g.:
su -c "yum -y install telnet"
or:
sudo aptitude install telnet
