The free culture and free software threads of my work have a commonality. Both are post-scarcity strategies. A program like draw-something can generate everyone in the world as many images as they like. Its work is not scarce. A series like Canto draws on a world already saturated with images as its nature.  
I do not make any claims about the idea of a post-scarcity society. Just that this work exists in or creates a limited domain of post-scarcity.
