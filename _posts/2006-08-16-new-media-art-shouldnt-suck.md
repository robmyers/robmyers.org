_MTAA has been wanting to move into the gallery for quite some time now. In order to do so, we'll need to start thinking that our audience is completely ignorant of digital culture. We can't expect them to be geeks that are excited about a good hack. We'll need to communicate our emotion, interest and excitement. We can't expect them to share it until we communicate every bit of it._  
  
_I can't believe it took me so long to realize thisâ€¦_  
  
Welcome to the dark side, MTAA. ;-)
