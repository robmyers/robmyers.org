Next up will be "Paint Something", which fills in the shapes and deals with colour, and then "Get Ready", which will generate multiple figures and work out a composition through a number of 'preparatory sketches'.  
Before that I want to add noise to Draw Something's lines (to simulate neural noise; hand jitters) and clean up the PostScript generation.
